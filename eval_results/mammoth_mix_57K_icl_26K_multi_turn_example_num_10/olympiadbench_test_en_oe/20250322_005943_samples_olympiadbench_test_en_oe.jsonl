When Turbo is at an arbitrary point $A$ different from $P$, the two arcs $A P$ have total length 1; therefore, the larger of the two the arcs (or either arc in case $A$ is diametrically opposite to $P$ ) must have length $\\geqslant \\frac{1}{2}$. By always choosing this larger arc (or either arc in case $A$ is diametrically opposite to $P$ ), Turbo will manage to avoid the point $P$ forever.\n\nFor $C>\\frac{1}{2}$, we write $C=\\frac{1}{2}+a$ with $a>0$, and we choose the sequence\n\n$$\n\\frac{1}{2}, \\quad \\frac{1+a}{2}, \\quad \\frac{1}{2}, \\quad \\frac{1+a}{2}, \\quad \\frac{1}{2}, \\ldots\n$$\n\nIn other words, $c_{i}=\\frac{1}{2}$ if $i$ is odd and $c_{i}=\\frac{1+a}{2}<C$ when $i$ is even. We claim Turbo must eventually visit all points on the circle. This is clear when it crawls in the same direction two times in a row; after all, we have $c_{i}+c_{i+1}>1$ for all $i$. Therefore, we are left with the case that Turbo alternates crawling clockwise and crawling counterclockwise. If it, without loss of generality, starts by going clockwise, then it will always crawl a distance $\\frac{1}{2}$ clockwise followed by a distance $\\frac{1+a}{2}$ counterclockwise. The net effect is that it crawls a distance $\\frac{a}{2}$ counterclockwise. Because $\\frac{a}{2}$ is positive, there exists a positive integer $N$ such that $\\frac{a}{2} \\cdot N>1$. After $2 N$ crawls, Turbo will have crawled a distance $\\frac{a}{2}$ counterclockwise $N$ times, therefore having covered a total distance of $\\frac{a}{2} \\cdot N>1$, meaning that it must have crawled over all points on the circle.\n\nNote: Every sequence of the form $c_{i}=x$ if $i$ is odd, and $c_{i}=y$ if $i$ is even, where $0<x, y<C$, such that $x+y \\geqslant 1$, and $x \\neq y$ satisfies the conditions with the same argument. There might be even more possible examples.", "To show that $C\\le \\frac12$\n\nWe consider the following related problem:\n\nWe assume instead that the snail Chet is moving left and right on the real line. Find the size $M$ of the smallest (closed) interval, that we cannot force Chet out of, using a sequence of real numbers $d_{i}$ with $0<d_{i}<1$ for all $i$.\n\nThen $C=1 / M$. Indeed if for every sequence $c_{1}, c_{2}, \\ldots$, with $c_{i}<C$ there exists a point that Turbo can avoid, then the circle can be cut open at the avoided point and mapped to an interval of size $M$ such that Chet can stay inside this interval for any sequence of the from $c_{1} / C, c_{2} / C, \\ldots$, see Figure 5 . However, all sequences $d_{1}, d_{2}, \\ldots$ with $d_{i}<1$ can be written in this form. Similarly if for every sequence $d_{1}, d_{2}, \\ldots$, there exists an interval of length smaller or equal $M$ that we cannot force Chet out of, this projects to a subset of the circle, that we cannot force Turbo out of using any sequence of the form $d_{1} / M, d_{2} / M, \\ldots$. These are again exactly all the sequences with elements in $[0, C)$.\n\n<img_3381>\n\nFigure 5: Chet and Turbo equivalence\n\nClaim: $M \\geqslant 2$.\n\nProof. Suppose not, so $M<2$. Say $M=2-2 \\varepsilon$ for some $\\varepsilon>0$ and let $[-1+\\varepsilon, 1-\\varepsilon]$ be a minimal interval, that Chet cannot be forced out of. Then we can force Chet arbitrarily close to $\\pm(1-\\varepsilon)$. In partiular, we can force Chet out of $\\left[-1+\\frac{4}{3} \\varepsilon, 1-\\frac{4}{3} \\varepsilon\\right]$ by minimality of $M$. This means that there exists a sequence $d_{1}, d_{2}, \\ldots$ for which Chet has to leave $\\left[-1+\\frac{4}{3} \\varepsilon, 1-\\frac{4}{3} \\varepsilon\\right]$, which means he ends up either in the interval $\\left[-1+\\varepsilon,-1+\\frac{4}{3} \\varepsilon\\right)$ or in the interval $\\left(1-\\frac{4}{3} \\varepsilon, 1-\\varepsilon\\right]$.\n\nNow consider the sequence,\n\n$$\nd_{1}, 1-\\frac{7}{6} \\varepsilon, 1-\\frac{2}{3} \\varepsilon, 1-\\frac{2}{3} \\varepsilon, 1-\\frac{7}{6} \\varepsilon, d_{2}, 1-\\frac{7}{6} \\varepsilon, 1-\\frac{2}{3} \\varepsilon, 1-\\frac{2}{3} \\varepsilon, 1-\\frac{7}{6} \\varepsilon, d_{3}, \\ldots\n$$\n\nobtained by adding the sequence $1-\\frac{7}{6} \\varepsilon, 1-\\frac{2}{3} \\varepsilon, 1-\\frac{2}{3} \\varepsilon, 1-\\frac{7}{6} \\varepsilon$ in between every two steps. We claim that this sequence forces Chet to leave the larger interval $[-1+\\varepsilon, 1-\\varepsilon]$. Indeed no two consecutive elements in the sequence $1-\\frac{7}{6} \\varepsilon, 1-\\frac{2}{3} \\varepsilon, 1-\\frac{2}{3} \\varepsilon, 1-\\frac{7}{6} \\varepsilon$ can have the same sign, because the sum of any two consecutive terms is larger than $2-2 \\varepsilon$ and Chet would leave the interval $[-1+\\varepsilon, 1-\\varepsilon]$. It follows that the $\\left(1-\\frac{7}{6} \\varepsilon\\right)$ 's and the $\\left(1-\\frac{2}{3} \\varepsilon\\right)$ 's cancel out, so the position after $d_{k}$ is the same as before $d_{k+1}$. Hence, the positions after each $d_{k}$ remain the same as in the original sequence. Thus, Chet is also forced to the boundary in the new sequence.\n\nIf Chet is outside the interval $\\left[-1+\\frac{4}{3} \\varepsilon, 1-\\frac{4}{3} \\varepsilon\\right]$, then Chet has to move $1-\\frac{7}{6} \\varepsilon$ towards 0 , and ends in $\\left[-\\frac{1}{6} \\varepsilon, \\frac{1}{6} \\varepsilon\\right]$. Chet then has to move by $1-\\frac{2}{3} \\varepsilon$, which means that he has to leave the interval $[-1+\\varepsilon, 1-\\varepsilon]$. Indeed the absolute value of the final position is at least $1-\\frac{5}{6} \\varepsilon$. This contradicts the assumption, that we cannot force Chet out of $[-1+\\varepsilon, 1-\\varepsilon]$. Hence $M \\geqslant 2$ as needed."]}, "target": "answer", "arguments": {"0": "until", "1": "max_new_tokens", "2": "temperature", "3": "top_p", "4": "num_beams", "5": "do_sample", "6": "max_tokens"}, "resps": [["To determine the largest constant \\( C > 0 \\) such that for every sequence of positive real numbers \\( c_{1}, c_{2}, c_{3}, \\ldots \\) with \\( c_{i} < C \\) for all \\( i \\), Turbo can ensure that there is some point on the circle that it will never visit or crawl across, we need to analyze the behavior of Turbo's movement on the circle.\n\nConsider the circle as a unit interval \\([0, 1)\\) with addition modulo 1.
