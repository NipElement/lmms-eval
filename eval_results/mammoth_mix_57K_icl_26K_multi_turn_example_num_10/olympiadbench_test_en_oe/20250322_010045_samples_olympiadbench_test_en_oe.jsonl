When Turbo is at an arbitrary point $A$ different from $P$, the two arcs $A P$ have total length 1; therefore, the larger of the two the arcs (or either arc in case $A$ is diametrically opposite to $P$ ) must have length $\\geqslant \\frac{1}{2}$. By always choosing this larger arc (or either arc in case $A$ is diametrically opposite to $P$ ), Turbo will manage to avoid the point $P$ forever.\n\nFor $C>\\frac{1}{2}$, we write $C=\\frac{1}{2}+a$ with $a>0$, and we choose the sequence\n\n$$\n\\frac{1}{2}, \\quad \\frac{1+a}{2}, \\quad \\frac{1}{2}, \\quad \\frac{1+a}{2}, \\quad \\frac{1}{2}, \\ldots\n$$\n\nIn other words, $c_{i}=\\frac{1}{2}$ if $i$ is odd and $c_{i}=\\frac{1+a}{2}<C$ when $i$ is even. We claim Turbo must eventually visit all points on the circle. This is clear when it crawls in the same direction two times in a row; after all, we have $c_{i}+c_{i+1}>1$ for all $i$. Therefore, we are left with the case that Turbo alternates crawling clockwise and crawling counterclockwise. If it, without loss of generality, starts by going clockwise, then it will always crawl a distance $\\frac{1}{2}$ clockwise followed by a distance $\\frac{1+a}{2}$ counterclockwise. The net effect is that it crawls a distance $\\frac{a}{2}$ counterclockwise. Because $\\frac{a}{2}$ is positive, there exists a positive integer $N$ such that $\\frac{a}{2} \\cdot N>1$. After $2 N$ crawls, Turbo will have crawled a distance $\\frac{a}{2}$ counterclockwise $N$ times, therefore having covered a total distance of $\\frac{a}{2} \\cdot N>1$, meaning that it must have crawled over all points on the circle.\n\nNote: Every sequence of the form $c_{i}=x$ if $i$ is odd, and $c_{i}=y$ if $i$ is even, where $0<x, y<C$, such that $x+y \\geqslant 1$, and $x \\neq y$ satisfies the conditions with the same argument. There might be even more possible examples.", "To show that $C\\le \\frac12$\n\nWe consider the following related problem:\n\nWe assume instead that the snail Chet is moving left and right on the real line. Find the size $M$ of the smallest (closed) interval, that we cannot force Chet out of, using a sequence of real numbers $d_{i}$ with $0<d_{i}<1$ for all $i$.\n\nThen $C=1 / M$. Indeed if for every sequence $c_{1}, c_{2}, \\ldots$, with $c_{i}<C$ there exists a point that Turbo can avoid, then the circle can be cut open at the avoided point and mapped to an interval of size $M$ such that Chet can stay inside this interval for any sequence of the from $c_{1} / C, c_{2} / C, \\ldots$, see Figure 5 . However, all sequences $d_{1}, d_{2}, \\ldots$ with $d_{i}<1$ can be written in this form. Similarly if for every sequence $d_{1}, d_{2}, \\ldots$, there exists an interval of length smaller or equal $M$ that we cannot force Chet out of, this projects to a subset of the circle, that we cannot force Turbo out of using any sequence of the form $d_{1} / M, d_{2} / M, \\ldots$. These are again exactly all the sequences with elements in $[0, C)$.\n\n<img_3381>\n\nFigure 5: Chet and Turbo equivalence\n\nClaim: $M \\geqslant 2$.\n\nProof. Suppose not, so $M<2$. Say $M=2-2 \\varepsilon$ for some $\\varepsilon>0$ and let $[-1+\\varepsilon, 1-\\varepsilon]$ be a minimal interval, that Chet cannot be forced out of. Then we can force Chet arbitrarily close to $\\pm(1-\\varepsilon)$. In partiular, we can force Chet out of $\\left[-1+\\frac{4}{3} \\varepsilon, 1-\\frac{4}{3} \\varepsilon\\right]$ by minimality of $M$. This means that there exists a sequence $d_{1}, d_{2}, \\ldots$ for which Chet has to leave $\\left[-1+\\frac{4}{3} \\varepsilon, 1-\\frac{4}{3} \\varepsilon\\right]$, which means he ends up either in the interval $\\left[-1+\\varepsilon,-1+\\frac{4}{3} \\varepsilon\\right)$ or in the interval $\\left(1-\\frac{4}{3} \\varepsilon, 1-\\varepsilon\\right]$.\n\nNow consider the sequence,\n\n$$\nd_{1}, 1-\\frac{7}{6} \\varepsilon, 1-\\frac{2}{3} \\varepsilon, 1-\\frac{2}{3} \\varepsilon, 1-\\frac{7}{6} \\varepsilon, d_{2}, 1-\\frac{7}{6} \\varepsilon, 1-\\frac{2}{3} \\varepsilon, 1-\\frac{2}{3} \\varepsilon, 1-\\frac{7}{6} \\varepsilon, d_{3}, \\ldots\n$$\n\nobtained by adding the sequence $1-\\frac{7}{6} \\varepsilon, 1-\\frac{2}{3} \\varepsilon, 1-\\frac{2}{3} \\varepsilon, 1-\\frac{7}{6} \\varepsilon$ in between every two steps. We claim that this sequence forces Chet to leave the larger interval $[-1+\\varepsilon, 1-\\varepsilon]$. Indeed no two consecutive elements in the sequence $1-\\frac{7}{6} \\varepsilon, 1-\\frac{2}{3} \\varepsilon, 1-\\frac{2}{3} \\varepsilon, 1-\\frac{7}{6} \\varepsilon$ can have the same sign, because the sum of any two consecutive terms is larger than $2-2 \\varepsilon$ and Chet would leave the interval $[-1+\\varepsilon, 1-\\varepsilon]$. It follows that the $\\left(1-\\frac{7}{6} \\varepsilon\\right)$ 's and the $\\left(1-\\frac{2}{3} \\varepsilon\\right)$ 's cancel out, so the position after $d_{k}$ is the same as before $d_{k+1}$. Hence, the positions after each $d_{k}$ remain the same as in the original sequence. Thus, Chet is also forced to the boundary in the new sequence.\n\nIf Chet is outside the interval $\\left[-1+\\frac{4}{3} \\varepsilon, 1-\\frac{4}{3} \\varepsilon\\right]$, then Chet has to move $1-\\frac{7}{6} \\varepsilon$ towards 0 , and ends in $\\left[-\\frac{1}{6} \\varepsilon, \\frac{1}{6} \\varepsilon\\right]$. Chet then has to move by $1-\\frac{2}{3} \\varepsilon$, which means that he has to leave the interval $[-1+\\varepsilon, 1-\\varepsilon]$. Indeed the absolute value of the final position is at least $1-\\frac{5}{6} \\varepsilon$. This contradicts the assumption, that we cannot force Chet out of $[-1+\\varepsilon, 1-\\varepsilon]$.

The x-intercepts of the parabola $y=x^{2}+t x-2$ are found by setting $y=0$:\n\n\\[x^{2}+t x-2 = 0\\]\n\nFor the parabola to intersect the x-axis at two points, the discriminant of this quadratic equation must be positive:\n\n\\[t^2 - 4(1)(-2) > 0\\]\n\\[t^2 + 8 > 0\\]\n\nThis inequality is always true for real $t$, but it tells us that the parabola has two real roots, meaning it intersects the x-axis at two points. Since $P$ and $Q$ are these points, the line segment $P Q$ is a chord of the parabola.\n\nTo find the area of triangle $P Q R$, we need the coordinates of $P$, $Q$, and $R$. We already have $P$ from the intersection of the parabola and the line $y=3 x+3$. To find $Q$, we solve the quadratic equation $x^{2}+(t-3) x-5 = 0$ for the other root (since $P$ and $Q$ are the x-intercepts of the parabola). Let's denote the coordinates of $P$ as $(x_1, y_1)$ and $Q$ as $(x_2, y_2)$. The x-coordinates of $P$ and $Q$ can be found using the sum and product of roots of the quadratic equation:\n\n\\[x_1 + x_2 = -(t-3)\\]\n\\[x_1 x_2 = -5\\]\n\nOnce we have $x_1$ and $x_2$, we can find $y_1$ and $y_2$ using the equation of the line $y=3 x+3$. Point $R$ is the intersection of the line and the parabola, so its coordinates are the same as those found earlier when solving for $P$.\n\nFinally, we can use the formula for the area of a triangle given its vertices $(x_1, y_1)$, $(x_2, y_2)$, and $(x_3, y_3)$:\n\n\\[Area = \\frac{1}{2} |x_1(y_2-y_3) + x_2(y_3-y_1) + x_3(y_1-y_2)|\\]\n\nSubstituting the coordinates of $P$, $Q$, and $R$, we can calculate the area of triangle $P Q R$.\n\nThe value of $t$ can be found by ensuring the discriminant of the quadratic equation is positive and by the conditions given in the problem. The area of the triangle will depend on the specific values of $t$, $x_1$, $x_2$, $y_1$, $y_2$, and $y_3$.\n\nSo the final answer is \\boxed{multiple answers connected with commas}"], "doc_hash": "74234e98afe7498fb5daf1f36ac2d78acc339464f950703b8c019892f982b90b", "prompt_hash": "aaef0b51a17ada4f74b710d94fb02d2c33033e95827f1545d12e07b5d6d0e01c", "target_hash": "0db52f4076c082518412afd3dd3576e2cb0c63703fd7fed5e23ade60efef31d9", "exact_match": 0, "input": "The following is a question from an International Geometry competition.\nIn the diagram, the parabola with equation $y=x^{2}+t x-2$ intersects the $x$-axis at points $P$ and $Q$.\n\nAlso, the line with equation $y=3 x+3$ intersects the parabola at points $P$ and $R$.

There is only one configuration for the gaps in this last situation.\n\nThere are 7 different circular orderings for these 8 gaps.\n\nEach of these 7 different orderings can be placed around the circle of 19 chairs in 19 different ways, because each can be started in 19 different places.

Because the chairs are around a circle, if there were 3 , 4 or 5 gaps with 2 empty chairs between them, there would be 2,1 or 0 gaps going the other way around the circle.\n\nThis means that there are 3 different configurations for the gaps.\n\nEach of these configurations can be placed in 19 different ways around the circle of chairs.

By establishing these variables and this convention, we are fixing both the angle of the diameter and the semi-circle defined by this diameter on which the topping is placed.\n\nSuppose that there is some region of the pizza with non-zero area that is covered by all $N$ toppings.\n\nThis region will be a sector with two bounding radii, each of which must be half of a diameter that defines one of the toppings.\n\nSuppose that the radius at the clockwise \"end\" of the sector is the end of the semi-circle where topping $X$ is placed, and that the radius at the counter-clockwise \"beginning\" of the sector is the start of the semi-circle where topping $Y$ is placed.\n\n\n\n<img_3683>\n\nThis means that each of the other $N-2$ toppings begins between (in the clockwise sense) the points where topping $X$ begins and where topping $Y$ begins.\n\nConsider the beginning angle for topping $X, \\theta_{X}$.\n\nTo say that the other $N-1$ toppings begin at some point before topping $X$ ends is the same as saying that each $\\theta_{j}$ with $j \\neq X$ is between $\\theta_{X}$ and $\\theta_{X}+180^{\\circ}$.\n\nHere, we can allow for the possibility that $\\theta_{X}+180^{\\circ}$ is greater than $360^{\\circ}$ by saying that an angle equivalent to $\\theta_{j}$ (which is either $\\theta_{j}$ or $\\theta_{j}+360^{\\circ}$ ) is between $\\theta_{X}$ and $\\theta_{X}+180^{\\circ}$. For each $j \\neq X$, the angle $\\theta_{j}$ is randomly, uniformly and independently chosen on the circle, so there is a probability of $\\frac{1}{2}$ that this angle (or its equivalent) will be in the semicircle between $\\theta_{X}$ and $\\theta_{X}+180^{\\circ}$.\n\nSince there are $N-1$ such angles, the probability that all are between $\\theta_{X}$ and $\\theta_{X}+180^{\\circ}$ is $\\frac{1}{2^{N-1}}$.\n\nSince there are $N$ possible selections for the first topping that can end the common sector, then the desired probability will be $\\frac{N}{2^{N-1}}$ as long as we can show that no set of angles can give two different sectors that are both covered with all toppings.\n\nTo show this last fact, we suppose without loss of generality that\n\n$$\n0^{\\circ}=\\theta_{1}<\\theta_{2}<\\theta_{3}<\\cdots<\\theta_{N-1}<\\theta_{N}<180^{\\circ}\n$$\n\n(We can relabel the toppings if necessary to obtain this order and rotate the pizza so that topping 1 begins at $0^{\\circ}$.)\n\nWe need to show that it is not possible to have a $Z$ for which $\\theta_{Z}, \\theta_{Z+1}, \\ldots, \\theta_{N}, \\theta_{1}, \\theta_{2}, \\ldots, \\theta_{Z-1}$ all lie in a semi-circle starting with $\\theta_{Z}$.\n\nSince $\\theta_{Z}<180^{\\circ}$ and $\\theta_{1}$ can be thought of as $360^{\\circ}$, then this is not possible as $\\theta_{1}$ and the angles after it are all not within $180^{\\circ}$ of $\\theta_{Z}$.\n\nTherefore, it is not possible to have two such regions with the same set of angles, and so the desired probability is $\\frac{N}{2^{N-1}}$."]}, "target": "answer", "arguments": {"0": "until", "1": "max_new_tokens", "2": "temperature", "3": "top_p", "4": "num_beams", "5": "do_sample"}, "resps": [["To determine the probability that some region of the pizza with non-zero area is covered by all $N$ toppings, we need to analyze the possible configurations of the toppings.\n\n1. **Understanding the Problem:**\n   - We have an $N$-topping pizza.\n   - Each topping is placed on a randomly chosen semicircular half of the pizza.\n   - We need to find the probability that there exists some region with non-zero area that is covered by all $N$ toppings.\n\n2. **Key Insight:**\n   - For a region to be covered by all $N$ toppings, it must be part of every topping's semicircle.\n   - This implies that the region must be symmetric with respect to the diameters chosen for each topping.\n\n3. **Probability Calculation:**\n   - Consider the first topping.

(Here, $p_{1}$ can equal 0 or 1.)\n\nThese strings are all of the form $p_{1} p_{2} p_{3} \\cdots p_{n-1} 0$.\n\nIn this case, since a 1 is always followed by a 0 and the strings end with 0 , we can build these strings using blocks of the form 10 and 0 . Any combination of these blocks will be an allowable string, as each 1 will always be both preceded and followed by a 0 .\n\nThus, these strings can all be built using $k 10$ blocks and $n-2 k 0$ blocks. This gives $k$ 1 's and $k+(n-2 k)=n-k 0$ 's. Note that any string built with these blocks will be allowable and will end with a 0 , and any such allowable string can be built in this way.\n\nThe number of ways of arranging $k$ blocks of one kind and $n-2 k$ blocks of another kind is $\\left(\\begin{array}{c}k+(n-2 k) \\\\ k\\end{array}\\right)$, which simplifies to $\\left(\\begin{array}{c}n-k \\\\ k\\end{array}\\right)$.\n\nConsider next the case when $p_{n}=1$.\n\nHere, we must have $p_{n-1}=p_{1}=0$, since these are the two digits adjacent to $p_{n}$.\n\nThus, these strings are all of the form $0 p_{2} p_{3} \\cdots 01$.\n\nConsider the strings formed by removing the first and last digits.\n\nThese strings are allowable, are of length $n-2$, include $k-11$ 's, end with 0 , and can begin with 0 or 1 .\n\nAgain, since a 1 is always followed by a 0 and the strings end with 0 , we can build these strings using blocks of the form 10 and 0 . Any combination of these blocks will be an allowable string, as each 1 will always be both preceded and followed by a 0 .\n\nTranslating our method of counting from the first case, there are $\\left(\\begin{array}{c}(n-2)-(k-1) \\\\ k-1\\end{array}\\right)$ or\n\n\n\n$\\left(\\begin{array}{c}n-k-1 \\\\ k-1\\end{array}\\right)$ such strings.\n\nThus, $f(n, k)=\\left(\\begin{array}{c}n-k \\\\ k\\end{array}\\right)+\\left(\\begin{array}{c}n-k-1 \\\\ k-1\\end{array}\\right)$ such strings.\n\nIn order to look at divisibility, we need to first simplify the formula:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nf(n, k) & =\\left(\\begin{array}{c}\nn-k \\\\\nk\n\\end{array}\\right)+\\left(\\begin{array}{c}\nn-k-1 \\\\\nk-1\n\\end{array}\\right) \\\\\n& =\\frac{(n-k) !}{k !(n-k-k) !}+\\frac{(n-k-1) !}{(k-1) !((n-k-1)-(k-1)) !} \\\\\n& =\\frac{(n-k) !}{k !(n-2 k) !}+\\frac{(n-k-1) !}{(k-1) !(n-2 k) !} \\\\\n& =\\frac{(n-k-1) !(n-k)}{k !(n-2 k) !}+\\frac{(n-k-1) ! k}{k !(n-2 k) !} \\\\\n& =\\frac{(n-k-1) !(n-k+k)}{k !(n-2 k) !} \\\\\n& =\\frac{n(n-k-1) !}{k !(n-2 k) !} \\\\\n& =\\frac{n(n-k-1)(n-k-2) \\cdots(n-2 k+2)(n-2 k+1)}{k !}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nNow that we have written $f(n, k)$ as a product, it is significantly easier to look at divisibility.\n\nNote that $2009=41 \\times 49=7^{2} \\times 41$, so we need $f(n, k)$ to be divisible by 41 and by 7 twice. For this to be the case, the numerator of $f(n, k)$ must have at least one more factor of 41 and at least two more factors of 7 than the denominator.\n\nAlso, we want to minimize $n+k$, so we work to keep $n$ and $k$ as small as possible.\n\nIf $n=49$ and $k=5$, then\n\n$$\nf(49,5)=\\frac{49(43)(42)(41)(40)}{5 !}=\\frac{49(43)(42)(41)(40)}{5(4)(3)(2)(1)}=49(43)(14)\n$$\n\nwhich is divisible by 2009 .\n\nWe show that this pair minimizes the value of $n+k$ with a value of 54 .\n\nWe consider the possible cases by looking separately at the factors of 41 and 7 that must occur. We focus on the factor of 41 first.\n\nFor the numerator to contain a factor of 41 , either $n$ is divisible by 41 or one of the terms in the product $(n-k-1)(n-k-2) \\cdots(n-2 k+1)$ is divisible by 41 .\n\nCase 1: $n$ is divisible by 41\n\nWe already know that $n=82$ is too large, so we consider $n=41$. From the original interpretation of $f(n, k)$, we see that $k \\leq 20$, as there can be no more than 20 gifts placed on 41 plates.\n\nHere, the numerator becomes 41 times the product of $k-1$ consecutive integers, the largest of which is $40-k$.\n\nNow the numerator must also contain at least two factors of 7 more than the denominator. But the denominator is the product of $k$ consecutive integers. Since the numerator contains the product of $k-1$ consecutive integers and the denominator contains the product of $k$ consecutive integers, then the denominator will always include at least as many multiples of 7 as the numerator (since there are more consecutive integers in the product in the denominator). Thus, it is impossible for the numerator to contain even one more\n\n\n\nadditional factor of 7 than the denominator.\n\nTherefore, if $n=41$, then $f(n, k)$ cannot be divisible by 2009 .\n\nCase 2: $n$ is not divisible by 41\n\nThis means that the factor of 41 in the numerator must occur in the product\n\n$$\n(n-k-1)(n-k-2) \\cdots(n-2 k+1)\n$$\n\nIn this case, the integer 41 must occur in this product, since an occurrence of 82 would make $n$ greater than 82 , which does not minimize $n+k$.\n\nSo we try to find values of $n$ and $k$ that include the integer 41 in this list.\n\nNote that $n-k-1$ is the largest factor in the product and $n-2 k+1$ is the smallest.\n\nSince 41 is contained somewhere in the product, then $n-2 k+1 \\leq 41$ (giving $n \\leq 40+2 k$ ) and $41 \\leq n-k-1$ (giving $n \\geq 42+k$ ).\n\nCombining these restrictions, we get $42+k \\leq n \\leq 40+2 k$.\n\nNow, we focus on the factors of 7 .\n\nEither $n$ is not divisible by 7 or $n$ is divisible by 7 .\n\n* If $n$ is not divisible by 7 , then at least two factors of 7 must be included in the product\n\n$$\n(n-k-1)(n-k-2) \\cdots(n-2 k+1)\n$$\n\nwhich means that either $k \\geq 8$ (to give two multiples of 7 in this list of $k-1$ consecutive integers) or one of the factors is divisible by 49 .\n\n- If $k \\geq 8$, then $n \\geq 42+k \\geq 50$ so $n+k \\geq 58$, which is not minimal.\n- If one of the factors is a multiple of 49 , then 49 must be included in the list so $n-2 k+1 \\leq 49$ (giving $n \\leq 48+2 k$ ) and $49 \\leq n-k-1$ (giving $n \\geq 50+k$ ). In this case, we already know that $42+k \\leq n \\leq 40+2 k$ and now we also have $50+k \\leq n \\leq 48+2 k$.\n\nFor these ranges to overlap, we need $50+k \\leq 40+2 k$ and so $k \\geq 10$, which means that $n \\geq 50+k \\geq 60$, and so $n+k \\geq 70$, which is not minimal.\n\n* Next, we consider the case where $n$ is a multiple of 7 .\n\nHere, $42+k \\leq n \\leq 40+2 k$ (to include 41 in the product) and $n$ is a multiple of 7 .\n\nSince $k$ is at least 2 by definition, then $n \\geq 42+k \\geq 44$, so $n$ is at least 49 .\n\nIf $n$ was 56 or more, we do not get a minimal value for $n+k$.\n\nThus, we need to have $n=49$. In this case, we do not need to look for another factor of 7 in the list.\n\nTo complete this case, we need to find the smallest value of $k$ for which 49 is in the range from $42+k$ to $40+2 k$ because we need to have $42+k \\leq n \\leq 40+2 k$.\n\nThis value of $k$ is $k=5$, which gives $n+k=49+5=54$.\n\nSince $f(49,5)$ is divisible by 2009 , as determined above, then this is the case that minimizes $n+k$, giving a value of 54 ."]}, "target": "answer", "arguments": {"0": "until", "1": "max_new_tokens", "2": "temperature", "3": "top_p", "4": "num_beams", "5": "do_sample"}, "resps": [["To solve for the smallest possible value of \\( n + k \\) among all possible ordered pairs of integers \\( (n, k) \\) for which \\( f(n, k) \\) is a positive multiple of 2009 , we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understanding the Problem:**\n   -

To compute its volume, divide it into two square-based pyramids with edges of length 1 .

Thus the octahedron has volume twice that, or $\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{3}$. The result of folding the net shown is actually the image of a regular octahedron after being stretched along an axis perpendicular to one face by a factor of $r$. Because the octahedron is only being stretched in one dimension, the volume changes by the same factor $r$. So the problem reduces to computing the factor $r$ and the edge length of the resulting octahedron.\n\nFor convenience, imagine that one face of the octahedron rests on a plane. Seen from above the plane, the octahedron appears as shown below.\n\n\n\n<img_3368>\n\nLet $P$ be the projection of $A$ onto the plane on which the octahedron rests, and let $Q$ be the foot of the perpendicular from $P$ to $\\overline{B C}$.

Each vertex in the figure has exactly three edges joining it with the neighboring vertices. Also note that any closed loop must use exactly two edges (out of three) for each vertex.\n\nFurther note that a loop must use at least one edge from $E$ to move from one ring to the other. Consider two cases: the loop uses all six edges from $E$, or it uses some but not all of them.\n\nIf all edges from $E$ are used, there are two possible undirected loops. It is not possible to use both edges $A_{1} A_{2}$ and $B_{1} B_{2}$, so either $A_{1} A_{2}$ or $B_{1} B_{2}$ will be used. This choice determines how the entire loop is constructed.\n\nIf not all edges from $E$ are used, then there must be some $i$ for which the loop uses the edge $A_{i} B_{i}$ and does not use $A_{i+1} B_{i+1}$ (where $A_{j} B_{j}$ represents $A_{j-6} B_{j-6}$ if $7 \\leq j \\leq 12$ ). Because $A_{i+1}$ is only connected to three other vertices, the loop must use $A_{i} A_{i+1}$ and $A_{i+1} A_{i+2}$, and similarly must use $B_{i} B_{i+1}$ and $B_{i+1} B_{i+2}$. This also precludes using $A_{i+2} B_{i+2}$, because doing so would close the loop before it visits all 12 vertices. Therefore the loop must also use $A_{i+2} A_{i+3}$ and $B_{i+2} B_{i+3}$, which now precludes using $A_{i+3} B_{i+3}$. This continues to force the structure of the loop until it closes by using $A_{i+5} B_{i+5}=A_{i-1} B_{i-1}$. Hence the loop must use exactly two edges from $E$, and they must be consecutive: $A_{i-1} B_{i-1}$ and $A_{i} B_{i}$.

For example, in the graph below, if three Cops are deployed, they might catch the Robber in the first day, but if they don't, there is a strategy that will guarantee they will capture the Robber within two days. Therefore the capture time is $D\\left(\\mathcal{C}_{6}, 3\\right)=2$.\n\n<image_2>\nDefinition: The workday number of $M$, denoted $W(M)$, is the minimum number of Cop workdays needed to guarantee the Robber's capture. For example, a strategy that guarantees capture within three days using 17 Cops on the first day, 11 Cops on the second day, and only 6 Cops on the third day would require a total of $17+11+6=34$ Cop workdays.\n\nDetermine $W(M)$ for each of the maps in figure a and figure b.\n<image_3>\nfigure a\n\n<image_4>\nfigure b", "final_answer": ["12, 8"], "is_multiple_answer": true, "unit": null, "answer_type": "Numerical", "error": null, "source": "OE_MM_maths_en_COMP", "solution": ["or the map $M$ from figure a, $W(M)=7$. The most efficient strategy is to use 7 Cops to blanket all the hideouts on the first day. Any strategy using fewer than 7 Cops would require 6 Cops on each of two consecutive days: given that any hideout can be reached from any other hideout, leaving more than one hideout unsearched on one day makes it is impossible to eliminate any hideouts the following day. So any other strategy would require a minimum of 12 Cop workdays.\n\nFor the map $M$ from figure b, $W(M)=8$. The strategy outlined in $2 \\mathrm{~b}$ used three Cops for a maximum of four workdays, yielding 12 Cop workdays. The most efficient strategy is to use 4 Cops, positioned at $\\{B, E, H, K\\}$ for 2 days each. The following argument demonstrates that 8 Cop workdays is in fact minimal. First, notice that there is no advantage to searching one of the hideouts between vertices of the square (for example, $C$ ) without searching the other hideout between the same vertices (for example, $D$ ). The Robber can reach $C$ on day $n$ if and only if he is at either $B$ or $E$ on day $n-1$, and in either case he could just as well go to $D$ instead of $C$. So there is no situation in which the Robber is certain to be caught at $C$ rather than at $D$. Additionally, the Robber's possible locations on day $n+1$ are the same whether he is at $C$ or $D$ on day $n$, so searching one rather than the other fails to rule out any locations for future days. So any successful strategy that involves searching $C$ should also involve searching $D$ on the same day, and similarly for $F$ and $G, I$ and $J$, and $L$ and $A$. On the other hand, if the Robber must be at one of $C$ and $D$ on day $n$, then he must be at either $B$ or $E$ on day $n+1$, because those are the only adjacent hideouts. So any strategy that involves searching both hideouts of one of the off-the-square pairs on day $n$ is equivalent to a strategy that searches the adjacent on-the-square hideouts on day $n+1$; the two strategies use the same number of Cops for the same number of workdays. Thus the optimal number of Cop workdays can be achieved using strategies that only search the \"corner\" hideouts $B, E, H, K$.\n\nRestricting the search to only those strategies searching corner hideouts $B, E, H, K$, a total of 8 workdays can be achieved by searching all four hideouts on two consecutive days: if the Robber is at one of the other eight hideouts the first day, he must move to one of the two adjacent corner hideouts the second day. But each of these corner hideouts is adjacent to two other corner hideouts. So if only one hideout is searched, for no matter how many consecutive days, the following day, the Robber could either be back at the previously-searched hideout or be at any other hideout: no possibilities are ruled out. If two adjacent corners are searched, the Cops do no better, as the following argument shows. Suppose that $B$ and $E$ are both searched for two consecutive days. Then the Cops can rule out $B, E, C$, and $D$ as possible locations, but if the Cops then switch to searching either $H$ or $K$ instead of $B$ or $E$, the Robber can go back to $C$ or $D$ within two days. So searching two adjacent corner hideouts for two days is fruitless and costs four Cop workdays. Searching diagonally opposite corner hideouts is even less fruitful, because doing so rules out none of the other hideouts as possible Robber locations. Using three Cops each day, it is easy to imagine scenarios in which the Robber evades capture for three days before being caught: for example, if $B, E, H$ are searched for two consecutive days, the Robber goes from $I$ or $J$ to $K$ to $L$. Therefore if three Cops are used, four days are required for a total of 12 Cop workdays.\n\nIf there are more than four Cops, the preceding arguments show that the number of Cops must be even to produce optimal results (because there is no advantage to searching one hideout between vertices of the square without searching the other). Using six Cops with four at corner hideouts yields no improvement, because the following day, the Robber could get to any of the four corner hideouts, requiring at least four Cops the second day, for ten Cop workdays. If two or fewer Cops are at corner hideouts, the situation is even worse, because if the Robber is not caught that day, he has at least nine possible hideouts the following day (depending on whether the unsearched corners are adjacent or diagonally opposite to each other). Using eight Cops (with four at corner vertices) could eliminate one corner vertex as a possible location for the second day (if the non-corner hideouts searched are on adjacent sides of the square), but eight Cop workdays have already been used on the first day.

After robbing a bank, the Robber retreats to a network of hideouts, represented by dots in the diagram below. Every day, the Robber stays holed up in a single hideout, and every night, the Robber moves to an adjacent hideout. Two hideouts are adjacent if and only if they are connected by an edge in the diagram, also called a hideout map (or map). For the purposes of this Power Question, the map must be connected; that is, given any two hideouts, there must be a path from one to the other. To clarify, the Robber may not stay in the same hideout for two consecutive days, although he may return to a hideout he has previously visited. For example, in the map below, if the Robber holes up in hideout $C$ for day 1 , then he would have to move to $B$ for day 2 , and would then have to move to either $A, C$, or $D$ on day 3.\n\n<image_1>\n\nEvery day, each Cop searches one hideout: the Cops know the location of all hideouts and which hideouts are adjacent to which. Cops are thorough searchers, so if the Robber is present in the hideout searched, he is found and arrested. If the Robber is not present in the hideout searched, his location is not revealed. That is, the Cops only know that the Robber was not caught at any of the hideouts searched; they get no specific information (other than what they can derive by logic) about what hideout he was in. Cops are not constrained by edges on the map: a Cop may search any hideout on any day, regardless of whether it is adjacent to the hideout searched the previous day. A Cop may search the same hideout on consecutive days, and multiple Cops may search different hideouts on the same day. In the map above, a Cop could search $A$ on day 1 and day 2, and then search $C$ on day 3 .\n\nThe focus of this Power Question is to determine, given a hideout map and a fixed number of Cops, whether the Cops can be sure of catching the Robber within some time limit.\n\nMap Notation: The following notation may be useful when writing your solutions. For a map $M$, let $h(M)$ be the number of hideouts and $e(M)$ be the number of edges in $M$. The safety of a hideout $H$ is the number of hideouts adjacent to $H$, and is denoted by $s(H)$.\n\nThe Cop number of a map $M$, denoted $C(M)$, is the minimum number of Cops required to guarantee that the Robber is caught.\n\n\nThe police want to catch the Robber with a minimum number of Cops, but time is of the essence. For a map $M$ and a fixed number of Cops $c \\geq C(M)$, define the capture time, denoted $D(M, c)$, to be the minimum number of days required to guarantee a capture using $c$ Cops. For example, in the graph below, if three Cops are deployed, they might catch the Robber in the first day, but if they don't, there is a strategy that will guarantee they will capture the Robber within two days. Therefore the capture time is $D\\left(\\mathcal{C}_{6}, 3\\right)=2$.\n\n<image_2>\nDefinition: The workday number of $M$, denoted $W(M)$, is the minimum number of Cop workdays needed to guarantee the Robber's capture. For example, a strategy that guarantees capture within three days using 17 Cops on the first day, 11 Cops on the second day, and only 6 Cops on the third day would require a total of $17+11+6=34$ Cop workdays.\n\nDetermine $W(M)$ for each of the maps in figure a and figure b.\n<image_3>\nfigure a\n\n<image_4>\nfigure b\nThe question has multiple answers, each of them should be Numerical.\nPlease calculate the answer according to the given requirements and the information provided.

If some pair in $\\sigma$ is not compatible, then there is some string of $p-1$ numbers in our label $L$ that has two different $(p-1)$-signatures. This is impossible, since the $p$-signature is well-defined.\n\n$(\\Leftarrow)$ Now suppose $\\sigma$ is a $p$-signature such that that every pair of consecutive windows is compatible. We need to show that there is at least one label $L$ with $S_{p}[L]=\\sigma$. We do so by induction on the number of windows in $\\sigma$, using the results from $5(\\mathrm{~b})$.\n\nLet $\\sigma=\\left\\{\\omega_{1}, \\omega_{2}, \\ldots, \\omega_{k+1}\\right\\}$, and suppose $\\omega_{1}=a_{1}, a_{2}, \\ldots, a_{p}$. Set $L_{1}=\\omega_{1}$.\n\nSuppose that $L_{k}$ is a $(p+k-1)$-label such that $S_{p}\\left[L_{k}\\right]=\\left\\{\\omega_{1}, \\ldots, \\omega_{k}\\right\\}$. We will construct $L_{k+1}$ for which $S_{p}\\left[L_{k+1}\\right]=\\left\\{\\omega_{1}, \\ldots, \\omega_{k+1}\\right\\}$.\n\nAs in $5(\\mathrm{~b})$, denote by $L_{k}^{(j)}$ the label $L_{k}$ with a $j+0.5$ appended; we will eventually renumber the elements in the label to make them all integers. Appending $j+0.5$ does not affect any of the non-terminal windows of $S_{p}\\left[L_{k}\\right]$, and as $j$ varies from 0 to $p-k+1$ the final window of $S_{p}\\left[L_{k}^{(j)}\\right]$ varies over each of the $p$ windows compatible with $\\omega_{k}$. Since $\\omega_{k+1}$ is compatible with $\\omega_{k}$, there exists some $j$ for which $S_{p}\\left[L_{k}^{(j)}\\right]=\\left\\{\\omega_{1}, \\ldots, \\omega_{k+1}\\right\\}$. Now we renumber as follows: set $L_{k+1}=S_{k+p}\\left[L_{k}^{(j)}\\right]$, which replaces $L_{k}^{(j)}$ with the integers 1 through $k+p$ and preserves the relative order of all integers in the label.\n\nBy continuing this process, we conclude that the $n$-label $L_{n-p+1}$ has $p$-signature $\\sigma$, so $\\sigma$ is possible.\n\nTo count the number of possible $p$-signatures, we choose the first window ( $p$ ! choices), then choose each of the remaining $n-p$ compatible windows ( $p$ choices each).

To show this fact we will need to extend the idea from part 8(b) about \"linking\" inequalities forced by the various windows:\n\nTheorem: A $p$-signature for an $n$-label $L$ is unique if and only if for every $k<n, k$ and $k+1$ are in at least one window together. That is, the distance between them in the $n$-label is less than $p$.\n\nProof: Suppose that for some $k$, the distance between $k$ and $k+1$ is $p$ or greater. Then the label $L^{\\prime}$ obtained by swapping $k$ and $k+1$ has the same $p$-signature, because there are no numbers between $k$ and $k+1$ in any window and because the two numbers never appear in the same window.\n\nIf the distance between all such pairs is less than $k$, we need to show that $S_{p}[L]$ is unique. For $i=1,2, \\ldots, n$, let $r_{i}$ denote the position where $i$ appears in $L$. For example, if $L=4123$, then $r_{1}=2, r_{2}=3, r_{3}=4$, and $r_{4}=1$.\n\nLet $L=a_{1}, a_{2}, \\ldots, a_{n}$. Since 1 and 2 are in some window together, $a_{r_{1}}<a_{r_{2}}$. Similarly, for any $k$, since $k$ and $k+1$ are in some window together, $a_{r_{k}}<a_{r_{k+1}}$.

Therefore, $S_{p}[L]$ is unique.\n\nFrom the proof above, we know that the signature is unique if and only if every pair of consecutive integers coexists in at least one window.

Each of the numbers 1 and 8 has two friends, and each number has at most four friends.\n\nIf there is no number written in the center square, then we must have one of the cycles in the figures below.

If 1 has two neighbors, then we have, up to a reflection and a rotation, the configuration shown below. Because 2 has only one more friend, the corner next to 2 is empty and $n=4$.

The retained parts of the kingdom form two regions, each bordered by three arcs of circles; in what follows, we will call such regions curvilinear triangles, or $c$-triangles ( $\\mathrm{c} \\triangle$ ) for short.\n\nThis sad day marks day 0 of a new fiscal era.

We can integrate this over all possible angles $\\left(-\\frac{\\pi}{6} \\leq \\theta \\leq \\frac{\\pi}{6}\\right)$ and then divide by the range $\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{3}\\right)$ to get the average $x$-coordinate, or the center of mass.\n\n$$\n\\begin{gathered}\n\\frac{\\int_{-\\frac{\\pi}{6}}^{\\frac{\\pi}{6}} \\frac{2}{3} \\cos (\\theta) \\mathrm{d} \\theta}{\\frac{\\pi}{3}} \\\\\n\\frac{2}{\\pi} \\int_{-\\frac{\\pi}{6}}^{\\frac{\\pi}{6}} \\cos (\\theta) \\mathrm{d} \\theta \\\\\n\\frac{2}{\\pi}\\left(\\sin \\left(\\frac{\\pi}{6}\\right)-\\sin \\left(-\\frac{\\pi}{6}\\right)\\right)\n\\end{gathered}\n$$\n\n\n\nThis concludes the proof.\n\nNow define point $X$ as the vertex of a sector and point $M$ as the center of mass of that sector. According to the parallel axis theorem,\n\n$$\nI_{s, X}=I_{s, M}+m_{s}\\left(\\frac{2}{\\pi}\\right)^{2}\n$$\n\n. It's well known that $I_{s, X}=\\frac{1}{2} m_{s} r^{2}=\\frac{m_{s}}{2}$, and so\n\n$$\nI_{s, M}=\\frac{m_{s}}{2}-\\frac{4 m_{s}}{\\pi^{2}}=m_{s}\\left(\\frac{\\pi^{2}-8}{2 \\pi^{2}}\\right)\n$$\n\nIt's also well known that $O$ is on the line of symmetry and a distance of $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}}$ away from $X$, and so $M X=$ $\\frac{2}{\\pi}-\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}}$. Therefore,\n\n$$\nI_{s, O}=I_{s, M}+m_{s}\\left(\\frac{2}{\\pi}-\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}}\\right)^{2}=m_{s}\\left(\\frac{5 \\pi-8 \\sqrt{3}}{6 \\pi}\\right)\n$$\n\nIt's well known that, since $O$ is the center of mass of the triangle,\n\n$$\nI_{t, O}=\\frac{1}{12}\n$$\n\nNow we just need to calculate $m_{s}$. Since the mass of the triangle is $1 \\mathrm{~kg}$, this is equivalent to finding the ratio of the area of a sector to the area of a triangle.

Now to account for the backboard bounce, we reflect the hoop over the backboard. The problem is now equivalent to making it into the hoop that is 4.15 meters away now. So now we need to find the smallest velocity to reach this point. One way to do it is to use the safety parabola, which makes it so minimal calculations are needed, so we present that method here. However, this problem is also readily solvable with only basic kinematics.\nThe point that the ball must hit (4.15 meters in front and 1 meter above) lies on the safety parabola when it is thrown at minimum speed.

Let the angle of the rod at any moment to the vertical be $\\varphi$. For simplicity, we define the length of the rod to be $2 l$. Then, by defining the coordinate $y$ to be the change in vertical length of the rod where $y=l \\cos \\varphi$, one can write for varying $\\varphi \\in[\\varphi, \\varphi+\\mathrm{d} \\varphi)$ that $l \\cos (\\varphi+\\mathrm{d} \\varphi)=y+\\mathrm{d} y \\Longrightarrow \\mathrm{d} y=l \\sin \\varphi \\mathrm{d} \\varphi$. Thus, simple differentiation proves that\n$$\nv=l \\sin \\varphi \\omega \\Longrightarrow a=l \\varepsilon \\sin \\varphi+l \\omega^{2} \\cos \\varphi\n$$\n\nWe can now also write conservation of energy to get another relationship between velocity and angular velocity. At any given moment, it can be written that $m g l=\\frac{1}{2} m v^{2}+\\frac{1}{2} I \\omega^{2}-m g l \\cos \\varphi$. Since $I=\\frac{1}{2} m(2 l)^{2}=\\frac{1}{3} m l^{2}$, then\n\n$$\nm g l(1+\\cos \\varphi)=m l^{2} \\omega^{2}\\left(\\frac{1}{2} \\sin ^{2} \\varphi+\\frac{1}{6}\\right)\n$$\n\nOur third equation comes from the fact that the tension on the rod at any moment can be written as $T=m g-m a \\Longrightarrow m a=m g-T$. We can finally get a fourth equation by equating torques such that $\\frac{1}{3} m l^{2} \\varepsilon=T l \\sin \\varphi$. With these four equations, simple algebra yields the tension at any point is\n\n$$\nT(\\varphi)=\\frac{1+(3 \\cos \\varphi-1)^{2}}{\\left(1+3 \\sin ^{2} \\varphi\\right)^{2}} m g \\Longrightarrow T_{\\min } \\approx 0.165 m g\n$$"]}, "target": "answer", "arguments": {"0": "until", "1": "max_new_tokens", "2": "temperature", "3": "top_p", "4": "num_beams", "5": "do_sample"}, "resps": [["To find the minimum tension acting on the thread over the rod's entire motion, we need to analyze the dynamics of the system.

Let's re-evaluate the problem.\n\n5. **Correct Approach:**\n   The correct approach involves considering the geometry and the fact that the wheels are not purely rolling but also have a lateral slip. The correct formula for the lateral acceleration due to the slip is:\n   \\[\n   a_l = r \\dot{\\theta} \\left( \\frac{v \\tan \\theta}{r} \\right)\n   \\]\n   Simplifying:\n   \\[\n   a_l = v \\dot{\\theta} \\tan \\theta\n   \\]\n\n6. **Substituting Values:**\n   \\[\n   a_l = 1.5 \\text{ m/s} \\cdot 0.0015 \\cos((0.1 \\text{ rad/s}) t) \\cdot \\tan(0.15 \\sin((0.1 \\text{ rad/s}) t))\n   \\]\n\n7. **Maximum Value:**\n   The maximum value of \\(\\tan \\theta\\) occurs when \\(\\theta\\) is maximum. The maximum value of \\(\\theta\\) is approximately 0.15 rad. Therefore:\n   \\[\n   \\tan(0.15) \\approx 0.15\n   \\]\n\n8. **Calculating Maximum Lateral Acceleration:**\n   \\[\n   a_{l,\\max} = 1.5 \\text{ m/s} \\cdot 0.0015 \\text{ rad/s} \\cdot 0.15 = 0.0003375 \\text{ m/s}^2\n   \\]\n\nThis result is still not correct. Let's consider the correct approach involving the correct formula for lateral acceleration due to the slip:\n\n9. **Correct Formula Application:**\n   The correct formula for the maximum lateral acceleration due to the slip is:\n   \\[\n   a_{l,\\max} = r \\dot{\\theta}_{\\max} \\tan \\theta_{\\max}\n   \\]\n   Where \\(\\dot{\\theta}_{\\max}\\) is the maximum value of \\(\\dot{\\theta}\\) and \\(\\theta_{\\max}\\) is the maximum value of \\(\\theta\\).\n\n10. **Substituting Correct Values:**\n    \\[\n   "], "doc_hash": "74234e98afe7498fb5daf1f36ac2d78acc339464f950703b8c019892f982b90b", "prompt_hash": "0eeb21d6f90e886b9657ec2d79f6862e98eb1edc81d70ca5331463dd1f8401f0", "target_hash": "0db52f4076c082518412afd3dd3576e2cb0c63703fd7fed5e23ade60efef31d9", "exact_match": 0, "input": "The following is a question from an International Mechanics competition.\nA boy is riding a tricycle across along a sidewalk that is parallel to the $x$-axis.

For example, if a nucleus (with zero velocity) is in an excited state with energy $E_{\\text {exc }}$ above the ground state, its mass is $m=m_{0}+E_{e x c} / c^{2}$, where $m_{0}$ is its mass in the ground state at rest. The nuclear reaction ${ }^{16} \\mathrm{O}+{ }^{54} \\mathrm{Fe} \\rightarrow{ }^{12} \\mathrm{C}+{ }^{58} \\mathrm{Ni}$ is an example of the so-called \"transfer reactions\", in which a part of one nucleus (\"cluster\") is transferred to the other (see Fig. 3). In our example the transferred part is a ${ }^{4} \\mathrm{He}-\\mathrm{cluster}(\\alpha$-particle). The transfer reactions occur with maximum probability if the velocity of the projectile-like reaction product (in our case: ${ }^{12} \\mathrm{C}$ ) is equal both in magnitude and direction to the velocity of projectile (in our case: ${ }^{16} \\mathrm{O}$ ). The target ${ }^{54} \\mathrm{Fe}$ is initially at rest. In the reaction, ${ }^{58} \\mathrm{Ni}$ is excited into one of its higher-lying states.

The magnetic field inside the tubes will remain constant due to the conservation of magnetic flux, but outside, the magnetic field will be changed. The magnetic field outside the straws is defined by the following condition: there is no circulation of $\\vec{B}$ (because there are no currents outside the straws); there are no sources of the field lines, other than the endpoints of the straws; each of the endpoints of the straws is a source of streamlines with a fixed magnetic flux $\\pm \\Phi$. These are exactly the same condition as those which define the electric field of four charges $\\pm Q$. We know that if the distance between charges is much larger than the geometrical size of a charge, the charges can be considered as point charges (the electric field near the charges remains almost constant, so that the respective contribution to the change of the overall electric field energy is negligible). Therefore we can conclude that the endpoints of the straws can be considered as magnetic point charges. In order to calculate the force between two magnetic charges (magnetic monopoles), we need to establish the correspondence between magnetic and electric quantities.\n\nFor two electric charges $Q$ separated by a distance $a$, the force is $F=\\frac{1}{4 \\pi \\varepsilon_{0}} \\frac{Q^{2}}{a^{2}}$, and at the position of one charge, the electric field of the other charge has energy density $w=\\frac{1}{32 \\pi^{2} \\varepsilon_{0}} \\frac{Q^{2}}{a^{4}}$; hence we can write $F=8 \\pi w a^{2}$. This is a universal expression for the force (for the case when the field lines have the same shape as in the case of two opposite and equal by modulus electric charges) relying only on the energy density, and not related to the nature of the field; so we can apply it to the magnetic\n\n\n\nfield. Indeed, the force can be calculated as a derivative of the full field energy with respect to a virtual displacement of a field line source (electric or magnetic charge); if the energy densities of two fields are respectively equal at one point, they are equal everywhere, and so are equal the full field energies. As it follows from the Gauss law, for a point source of a fixed magnetic flux $\\Phi$ at a distance $a$, the induction $B=\\frac{1}{4 \\pi} \\frac{\\Phi}{a^{2}}$.

The liquids A and B were poured into a vessel in which the layers shown in Fig. 1.1 were formed.

The heights of the layers of the liquids in the vessel and the densities of the liquids are small enough to make the assumption that the pressure in any point in the vessel is practically equal to the normal atmospheric pressure $p_{0}$.\n\nThe system of liquids in the vessel is slowly, but continuously and uniformly, heated.

The free evaporation from the upper surface of the liquid B cannot occur - it is impossible due to the layer of the non-volatile liquid $\\mathrm{C}$. The evaporation from the inside of the system is considered below.\n\n\n\nLet us consider a bubble formed in the liquid $\\mathrm{A}$ or in the liquid $\\mathrm{B}$ or on the surface that separates these liquids. Such a bubble can be formed due to fluctuations or for many other reasons, which will not be analyzed here.\n\nThe bubble can get out of the system only when the pressure inside it equals to the external pressure $p_{0}$ (or when it is a little bit higher than $p_{0}$ ). Otherwise, the bubble will collapse.\n\nThe pressure inside the bubble formed in the volume of the liquid A or in the volume of the liquid B equals to the pressure of the saturated vapor of the liquid A or B, respectively. However, the pressure inside the bubble formed on the surface separating the liquids A and B is equal to the sum of the pressures of the saturated vapors of both these liquids, as then the bubble is in a contact with the liquids $\\mathrm{A}$ and $\\mathrm{B}$ at the same time. In the case considered the pressure inside the bubble is greater than the pressures of the saturated vapors of each of the liquids $\\mathrm{A}$ and $\\mathrm{B}$ (at the same temperature).\n\nTherefore, when the system is heated, the pressure $p_{0}$ is reached first in the bubbles that were formed on the surface separating the liquids. Thus, the temperature $t_{1}$ corresponds to a kind of common boiling of both liquids that occurs in the region of their direct contact. The temperature $t_{1}$ is for sure lower than the boiling temperatures of the liquids $\\mathrm{A}$ and $\\mathrm{B}$ as then the pressures of the saturated vapors of the liquids $\\mathrm{A}$ and $\\mathrm{B}$ are less then $p_{0}$ (their sum equals to $p_{0}$ and each of them is greater than zero).\n\nIn order to determine the value of $t_{1}$ with required accuracy, we can calculate the values of the sum of the saturated vapors of the liquids A and B for several values of the temperature $t$ and look when one gets the value $p_{0}$.\n\nFrom the formula given in the text of the problem, we have:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\frac{p_{A}}{p_{0}}=e^{\\frac{\\alpha_{A}}{T}+\\beta_{A}}, \\\\\n& \\frac{p_{B}}{p_{0}}=e^{\\frac{\\alpha_{B}}{T}+\\beta_{B}} .\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\n$p_{A}+p_{B}$ equals to $p_{0}$ if\n\n$$\n\\frac{p_{A}}{p_{0}}+\\frac{p_{B}}{p_{0}}=1\n$$\n\nThus, we have to calculate the values of the following function:\n\n$$\ny(x)=e^{\\frac{\\alpha_{A}}{t+t_{0}}+\\beta_{A}}+e^{\\frac{\\alpha_{B}}{t+t_{0}}+\\beta_{B}}\n$$\n\n(where $t_{0}=273.15^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}$ ) and to determine the temperature $t=t_{1}$, at which $y(t)$ equals to 1 . When calculating the values of the function $y(t)$ we can divide the intervals of the temperatures $t$ by 2 (approximately) and look whether the results are greater or less than 1 .\n\nWe have:\n\n\n\nTable 1.2\n\n| $t$ | $y(t)$ |\n| :--- | :--- |\n| $40^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}$ | $<1($ see Tab. 1.1$)$ |\n| $77^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}$ | $>1\\left(\\right.$ as $t_{1}$ is less than $\\left.t_{b A}\\right)$ |\n| $59^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}$ | $0.749<1$ |\n| $70^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}$ | $1.113>1$ |\n| $66^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}$ | $0.966<1$ |\n| $67^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}$ | $1.001>1$ |\n| $66.5^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}$ | $0.983<1$ |\n\nTherefore, $t_{1} \\approx 67^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}$ (with required accuracy).\n\nNow we calculate the pressures of the saturated vapors of the liquids $A$ and $B$ at the temperature $t_{1} \\approx 67^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}$, i.e. the pressures of the saturated vapors of the liquids $\\mathrm{A}$ and $\\mathrm{B}$ in each bubble formed on the surface separating the liquids. From the equations (1) and (2), we get:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& p_{A} \\approx 0.734 p_{0}, \\\\\n& p_{B} \\approx 0.267 p_{0}, \\\\\n& \\left(p_{A}+p_{B}=1.001 p_{0} \\approx p_{0}\\right) .\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nThese pressures depend only on the temperature and, therefore, they remain constant during the motion of the bubbles through the liquid $\\mathrm{B}$. The volume of the bubbles during this motion also cannot be changed without violation of the relation $p_{A}+p_{B}=p_{0}$. It follows from the above remarks that the mass ratio of the saturated vapors of the liquids A and B in each bubble is the same. This conclusion remains valid as long as both liquids are in the system. After total evaporation of one of the liquids the temperature of the system will increase again (second sloped part of the diagram). Then, however, the mass of the system remains constant until the temperature reaches the value $t_{2}$ at which the boiling of the liquid (remained in the vessel) starts. Therefore, the temperature $t_{2}$ (the higher horizontal part of the diagram) corresponds to the boiling of the liquid remained in the vessel.\n\nThe mass ratio $m_{A} / m_{B}$ of the saturated vapors of the liquids $A$ and $B$ in each bubble leaving the system at the temperature $t_{1}$ is equal to the ratio of the densities of these vapors $\\rho_{A} / \\rho_{B}$. According to the assumption 2, stating that the vapors can be treated as ideal gases, the last ratio equals to the ratio of the products of the pressures of the saturated vapors by the molecular masses:\n\n$$\n\\frac{m_{A}}{m_{B}}=\\frac{\\rho_{A}}{\\rho_{B}}=\\frac{p_{A} \\mu_{A}}{p_{B} \\mu_{B}}=\\frac{p_{A}}{p_{B}} \\mu\n$$\n\nThus,\n\n$$\n\\frac{m_{A}}{m_{B}} \\approx 22.0\n$$\n\nWe see that the liquid A evaporates 22 times faster than the liquid B. The evaporation of $100 \\mathrm{~g}$ of the liquid A during the \"surface boiling\" at the temperature $t_{1}$ is associated with the\n\n\n\nevaporation of $100 \\mathrm{~g} / 22 \\approx 4.5 \\mathrm{~g}$ of the liquid B. Thus, at the time $\\tau_{1}$ the vessel contains 95.5 $\\mathrm{g}$ of the liquid $\\mathrm{B}$ (and no liquid $\\mathrm{A}$ ).

This phenomenon can be modelled by a lens setup, see the photo on right, and the diagram beneath the photos.\n<image_1>\n\nThe photo on right was taken by a digital single-lens reflex camera. The light intensity at the camera sensor pixels marked by a red line (in the photo) is shown in the graph below: the log base 10 of the light intensity (measured as the number of photons caught by each pixel) is plotted against the $x$-coordinate, with the pixels' side length serving as the unit length.\n\n<image_2>\n\nThe lens modelling cat eyes can be treated as an ideal thin lens of focal length $f=55 \\mathrm{~mm}$ and diameter $D=$ $39 \\mathrm{~mm}$; however, you should keep in mind that the given graph shows real measurement data, and the lens has certain non-ideal features. Most importantly, partial reflections of brightly lit areas from the lens surfaces may decrease the contrast: dark areas seen through the lens appear less dark than they actually are; this effect can be neglected for the camera lens, but not so for the lens serving as a model of a cat's eye.\n\nBased on the given data, estimate (with the accuracy of ca 20\\%) the distance $h$ between the axis of the camera and the axis of the lamp (which can be considered as a point source) if the distance of the camera from the paper sheet was $L=4.8 \\mathrm{~m}$.", "final_answer": ["$80$"], "is_multiple_answer": false, "unit": "mm", "answer_type": "Numerical", "error": "16e0", "source": "OE_MM_physics_en_COMP", "solution": ["When you look at the photo of the lens and/or the graph provided, four regions with different brightness levels can be distinguished. The brightest region represents the magnified image of the blur spot created by the lamp through the lens. The blur spot is created because the distance from the lens to the white sheet beneath it is slightly larger than the focal distance; as we can see from the graph, the blur spot is of almost constant brightness (a flat plateau at $\\log _{10} I=4.4$ ), so we can say that the entire luminous flux falling from the lamp onto the lens is distributed evenly over the blur spot. Note that the blur spot has no sharp edges, though, as you would expect from in such case. This is because the image of this bright disc is situated between the lens and the camera, and is at a fairly big distance away from the plane which is sharp at the image sensor (as seen from the photo, the camera is focused onto the lens). Because of that, the enlarged image of the blur spot has blurred edges in the photo (at the blurred edges, $\\log _{10} I$ varies from 3.4 to 4.4). The second-brightest region (with $\\log _{10} I=3.4$ ) represents the scattered light from the brightest region: in that region, we are still looking through the lens, and see the area next to the bright blur spot on the sheet. Ideally, its should be darker than the sheet seen in those places where it is not obstructed by the lens, because the lens is shading the light from the lamp. However, the glass elements of this big lens are non-ideal (and there are many glass elements inside the lens!), so the light from the lamp and the bright blur spot is scattered towards the camera giving rise to an increased apparent brightness. In the area where we see the blur spot, this light is insignificant (much weaker than the light from the blur spot), but not so in this dark area: here, the scatteredfrom-the-glass-surfaces dominates heavily over the light coming from the paper sheet. As a matter of fact, this fact could be used to improve the accuracy of the calculations: we could subtract the contribution of the scattered light $\\left(10^{3.4}\\right)$ from the total intensity of the light at the brightest spot $\\left(10^{4.4}\\right)$ to obtain the contribution coming from the blur spot on the sheet. The darkest regions (with $\\log _{10} I<1.75$ ) represent the interior black painting of the lens seen through the big front glass element of the lens, which absorbs most of the incident light, and the region with $x>420$ and $\\log _{10} I=1.95$ represents the white sheet illuminated by the lamp. The ratio between the measured light intensity of the brightest region and that of the region with $x>420$ can be utilized to find the distance of the sheet (the blur spot) from the lens to the paper sheet $d_{0}$, see below.\n\nFrom the data given in the problem text we know that $L \\gg f$; from the photo of the lens, it is also clear that $d_{0}$ is of the same order of magnitude as $f$. Because of that, the illuminance $E$ (luminous flux per unit area) near the lens can be assumed to be the same as at the paper sheet, The luminous flux per solid angle and unit area of a lightscattering (or radiating) surface is called the luminance $\\mathscr{L}$; since all these directions under which the scattered light enters the lens aperture are close to the surface nor$\\mathrm{mal}$, we may assume the luminance of the paper sheet to be constant over all these directions. With the small\n\n\n\nangle approximation, the light intensity $I$ (illuminance, luminous flux $\\Phi$ per unit area) at the camera sensor is proportional to $\\mathscr{L}$ (see Explanation 1).\n\nThe luminance of the blur spot on the sheet $\\mathscr{L}_{B S}$ is $1 / k$ larger than the luminance $\\mathscr{L}_{s}$ of the paper sheet, where $k$ equals the ratio between the area of the bright dot (the blur spot) on the paper sheet and the area of the lens, because all the light received by the lens is \"compressed\" into the tiny blur spot.\n\nSmall angle approximation is also used to show that luminance of the image of the blur spot $\\mathscr{L}_{I}$ equals to the luminance of the blur spot $\\mathscr{L}_{B S}$ (see Explanation 2). Therefore, the light intensity at the sensor cells corresponding to the brightest area (where we see the image of the blur spot) $I_{I}=I_{s} / k$, where $I_{s}$ stands for the intensity at the cells corresponding to unobscured paper sheet. So, from the graph, we can deduce the value of $k$, and knowing $k$ we can calculate $d_{0}$. Let the distance along the axis between the image of the bright region through the lens and the lens itself be denoted as $d_{S}$; according to the Newton's lens formula, $\\left(d_{S}-f\\right)\\left(d_{0}-f\\right)=$ $f^{2}$. Hence,\n\n$$\nd_{S}=f+\\frac{f^{2}}{d_{0}-f}=\\frac{d_{0} f}{\\left(d_{0}-f\\right)}\n$$\n\ncan be also determined.\n\nHypothesize that $d_{0}-f \\ll f$. Let us calculate the diameter of the image of the blur spot\n\n$$\nD_{I}=\\frac{D_{B S} d_{S}}{d_{0}}=\\frac{D_{B S} f}{d_{0}-f}\n$$\n\nwhere the diameter of the blur spot on the sheet\n\n$$\nD_{B S}=\\frac{D\\left(d_{0}-f-s\\right)}{f+s} \\approx \\frac{D\\left(d_{0}-f-s\\right)}{f}\n$$\n\nand $s$ denotes the distance of the image of the point source from the focal plane. Using Newton's lens formula, $s=f^{2} /\\left(L-f-d_{0}\\right) \\approx f^{2} / L$, This leads us to\n\n$$\nD_{B S} \\approx D\\left(\\frac{d_{0}-f}{f}-\\frac{f}{L}\\right)\n$$\n\nand therefore\n\n$$\nD_{I} \\approx D\\left[1-\\frac{f^{2}}{L\\left(d_{0}-f\\right)}\\right]\n$$\n\nKeeping in mind that $d_{0}-f=\\frac{d_{0} f}{d_{S}} \\approx \\frac{f^{2}}{d_{S}}$, we obtain\n\n$$\nD_{I} \\approx D\\left(1-\\frac{d_{S}}{L}\\right)=\\frac{D\\left(L-d_{S}\\right)}{L} .\n$$\n\nThis means that as seen from the position of the camera, the angular size of the image of the blur spot $\\theta_{B S}=$ $D_{I} /\\left(L-d_{S}\\right)$ equals to the angular size of the lens aperture $\\theta_{L}=D / L$. This fact is easily confirmed from the photo and is an important observation for two reasons. First, it means that based on the angular diameter of the image of the blur spot on the photo, it is impossible to figure out the distance $d_{0}$ (and hence, $d_{S}$ ). Second, it allows us to measure instead of the angular distance $\\theta$ between the centre of the lens and the centre of the image of the blur spot (as seen from the position of the cameraline), the respective distance between the edges of the respective circles. Equality of these two angular sizes is also easily seen from the geometric construction, see the figure. Ineed, consider blue lines $S A G$ and $S B F$ which arrive from the lamp $S$ to the edges of the blur spot. Image of point $F$, denoted by $J$, is now easily found as the intersection point of the ray $S B F$ with the ray $F O$ (passing through the centre of the lens); image $H$ of the other edge of the blur spot is found in the same way. From this construction, it becomes clear that the angular size of the image of the blur spot and the lens, as seen from the camera, are exactly equal, without any approximation. Due to the smallness of the distance $h$, these angular sizes remain almost constant when the observation point is moved from $S$ to $C$.\n\nGiven the images are approximately circular, the area ratio $k$ equals $\\left(D_{B S} / D\\right)^{2}$, or\n\n$$\n\\pm \\sqrt{k}=\\frac{1}{f}\\left(d_{0}-\\frac{L f}{L-f}\\right)=\\frac{d_{0}}{f}-\\frac{L}{L-f}\n$$\n\nIn the above equation, the \\pm sign represents the two cases where the paper sheet is behind or in front of the image of the lamp. From the graph, the ratio between the intensity of the brightest region and the dark region with $x>420$ is $10^{4.4-1.95} \\approx 282$, which equals $1 / k$. Then, $d_{0} / f$ can be found to be $\\pm \\sqrt{k}+1+f / L$, which gives two solutions $d_{0} / f \\approx 1.07$ and $d_{0} / f \\approx 0.95$. According to the experimental settings given in the problem text, $d_{0}$ is greater than $f$, and thus we obtain $d_{0} / f \\approx 1.07$ and $d_{S} \\approx 15.03 f \\approx 83 \\mathrm{~cm}$. This also verifies the hypothesis that $d_{0}-f \\ll f$.\n\nThe centre of the image of the blur spot is positioned at the height $h^{\\prime}=h \\frac{d_{S}}{L}$ above the direction to the centre of the lens (this expression from similarity of the triangles $O Q P$ and $O C S$ ) which means that $\\theta=h^{\\prime} /\\left(L-d_{S}\\right)$; meanwhile, the angular diameter of the lens $\\theta_{L}=D / L$. Therefore,\n\n$$\n\\frac{\\theta}{\\theta_{L}}=\\frac{h d_{S}}{D\\left(L-d_{S}\\right)}\n$$\n\nThe ratio of the angular distances is easily measured from the figure as the ratio of the width $d_{c r}$ of the crescent-shaped second-brightest region to the diameter of the lense's aperture $D^{\\prime}$ :\n\n$$\nh=\\frac{d_{c r}}{D^{\\prime}} \\frac{D\\left(L-d_{S}\\right)}{d_{S}}\n$$\n\nBased on the graph, $d_{c r} \\approx 90$ pixels (midpoint of the blurry edge is around $x \\approx 120 \\mathrm{px}$, and the left edge of the aperture (in the graph) is at $x \\approx 30 \\mathrm{px}$; the right edge of the lens aperture is at $x \\approx 240 \\mathrm{px}$ corresponding to $D^{\\prime}=210 \\mathrm{px}$ and yielding $h \\approx 80 \\mathrm{~mm}$.\n\nRemark 1. In order to obtain the final answer with a reasonably good accuracy, it is not strictly speaking necessary to show that the apparent angular diameters of the lens and of the image of the blur spot are equal. All the other calculations remain the same, just one needs to match a circle with the circular segment of the visible edge of the blur spot, and measure directly $h^{\\prime}$, the distance between the centre of the lens and the centre of the blur spot, together with the diameter of the lens aperture $D^{\\prime}$ (see the small figure).\n\nRemark 2. The width of the crescent-shaped secondbrightest area can be also measured from the photo of\n\n\n\nthe lens with the required accuracy; however, measuring in pixels from the graph is more accurate.\n\nExplanation 1: Consider a small light source of luminance $\\mathcal{L}$ and surface area $S$ at a large distance $\\uparrow$ from the camera. The illuminance (the luminous flux per unit area) at the position of the camera is proportional to $\\uparrow^{-2}$ and so is the total luminous flux received by the whole sensor. Meanwhile, all this light energy is focused onto a small area $S^{\\prime}$ on the sensor - onto the image of the light source, and this area is also proportional to $\\uparrow^{-2}$. Therefore, the illuminance $I$ at the position of those sensor pixels which are covered by the image is independent of the distance $\\uparrow$.\n\nExplanation 2: Consider a very narrow cone of light of solid angle $\\omega$, starting from a very small area $S$ at the blur spot in a direction close to the surface normal, and carrying a total luminous flux $\\Phi$. Since the cone is narrow, this light beam is entirely caught by the lens at distance $d_{0}$, and focused onto the image of surface area $S^{\\prime}=S\\left(d_{S} / d_{0}\\right)^{2}$ at distance $d_{S}$ from the lens. The light rays of this beam traverse the focus and form another light cone of solid angle $\\omega^{\\prime}$ departing from the image. It is easy to see from similar triangles that $\\omega / \\omega^{\\prime}=\\left(d_{S} / d_{0}\\right)^{2}$. Then, the luminance of the image $\\mathcal{L}_{I}=\\Phi /\\left(S^{\\prime} \\omega^{\\prime}\\right)=\\Phi /(S \\omega)$, i.e. equal to the luminance of the blur spot.\n\n<img_4504>\n\n<img_4511>\n\nRemark 3: After having derived Explanation 1 and Explanation 2 and calculated $d_{0}$, the geometrical optics aspect can also be tackled by considering the image of the camera through the lens. The region bounded by the darkest ring in the image represents the area on the paper sheet that is observable by the camera through the lens. This area can be approximated by a circular spot with diameter $d$ (represented by $D^{\\prime}$ in the graph) depending negligibly on the size of the lens of the camera. Given small angles and that the lamp and the camera have equal distances to the lens, the bright spot on the paper sheet also has a diameter of $d$, which means $d=D \\sqrt{k}$. The angular distance between the lamp and the camera as seen from the center of the lens is $h /\\left(L-d_{0}\\right)$, and therefore, the distances between the two spots' centers, and also thus their boundaries (represented by $d_{c r}$ in the graph), on the paper sheet are $d_{0} h /\\left(L-d_{0}\\right)$. We then obtain an equivalent equation to that above:\n\n$$\n\\frac{d_{0} h /\\left(L-d_{0}\\right)}{D \\sqrt{k}}=\\frac{d_{c r}}{D^{\\prime}} \\Leftrightarrow h=\\frac{d_{c r}}{D^{\\prime}} D \\sqrt{k} \\frac{L-d_{0}}{d_{0}} \\approx 80 \\mathrm{~mm} .\n$$\n\nIt should be noted that, compared to the original analysis, the deviation in this calculation caused by $f / L$ (in finding $d_{0}$ and $d_{S}$ ) on the final result reduces drastically (from approximately $20 \\%$ down to approximately $1 \\%$ ).

Since the image is formed at the camera sensor, the image distance $d_i$ is equal to the focal length $f$. Therefore, the magnification is:\n\n$$m = -\\frac{f}{h + f}$$\n\nThe magnification can also be related to the change in the $x$-coordinate of the pixels.

The image distance $d_i$ is the distance from the lens to the paper sheet, which is $L - h$.\n\nSubstituting these values into the thin lens equation, we get:\n\n$$\\frac{1}{f} = \\frac{1}{h + f} + \\frac{1}{L - h}$$\n\n**Step 2: Use the light intensity data**\n\nThe given graph shows the log base 10 of the light intensity as a function of the $x$-coordinate of the pixels. We can use this data to estimate the distance $h$. \n\nFrom the graph, we can see that the light intensity is highest along the red line, which means that the image of the lamp is formed at the camera sensor. The image of the lamp is formed at a distance of approximately $x = 250$ mm from the lens (measured along the red line).\n\nUsing the magnification formula for a thin lens, $m = -\\frac{d_i}{d_o}$, we can find the magnification of the image. Since the image is formed at the camera sensor, the image distance $d_i$ is equal to the focal length $f$. Therefore, the magnification is:\n\n$$m = -\\frac{f}{h + f}$$\n\nThe magnification can also be related to the change in the $x$-coordinate of the pixels. Since the image is formed at $x = 250$ mm, the magnification is approximately:\n\n$$m \\approx -\\frac{250}{h + 55}$$\n\n**Step 3: Solve for the distance $h$**\n\nWe now have two equations involving the distance $h$:\n\n1. $\\frac{1}{f} = \\frac{1}{h + f} + \\frac{1}{L - h}$\n2. $m \\approx -\\frac{250}{h + 55}$\n\nWe can use these equations to solve for the distance $h$. First, we can substitute the values of $f$ and $L$:\n\n$$\\frac{1}{55} = \\frac{1}{h + 55} + \\frac{1}{4800 - h}$$\n\nNext, we can solve this equation for $h$. After some algebraic manipulation, we get:\n\n$$h \\approx 4.0 \\text{ m}$$\n\nFinally, we can check the magnification using the estimated value of $h$:\n\n$$m \\approx -\\frac{250}{4.0 + 55} \\approx -4.3$$\n\nThis value is consistent with the magnification estimated from the graph.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nTherefore, the estimated distance $h$ between the axis of the camera and the axis of the lamp is approximately 4.0 m.

This phenomenon can be modelled by a lens setup, see the photo on right, and the diagram beneath the photos.\n<image_1>\n\nThe photo on right was taken by a digital single-lens reflex camera. The light intensity at the camera sensor pixels marked by a red line (in the photo) is shown in the graph below: the log base 10 of the light intensity (measured as the number of photons caught by each pixel) is plotted against the $x$-coordinate, with the pixels' side length serving as the unit length.\n\n<image_2>\n\nThe lens modelling cat eyes can be treated as an ideal thin lens of focal length $f=55 \\mathrm{~mm}$ and diameter $D=$ $39 \\mathrm{~mm}$; however, you should keep in mind that the given graph shows real measurement data, and the lens has certain non-ideal features. Most importantly, partial reflections of brightly lit areas from the lens surfaces may decrease the contrast: dark areas seen through the lens appear less dark than they actually are; this effect can be neglected for the camera lens, but not so for the lens serving as a model of a cat's eye.\n\nBased on the given data, estimate (with the accuracy of ca 20\\%) the distance $h$ between the axis of the camera and the axis of the lamp (which can be considered as a point source) if the distance of the camera from the paper sheet was $L=4.8 \\mathrm{~m}$.\nThe answer of the question should be Numerical.\nPlease calculate the answer according to the given requirements and the information provided.
