When Turbo is at an arbitrary point $A$ different from $P$, the two arcs $A P$ have total length 1; therefore, the larger of the two the arcs (or either arc in case $A$ is diametrically opposite to $P$ ) must have length $\\geqslant \\frac{1}{2}$. By always choosing this larger arc (or either arc in case $A$ is diametrically opposite to $P$ ), Turbo will manage to avoid the point $P$ forever.\n\nFor $C>\\frac{1}{2}$, we write $C=\\frac{1}{2}+a$ with $a>0$, and we choose the sequence\n\n$$\n\\frac{1}{2}, \\quad \\frac{1+a}{2}, \\quad \\frac{1}{2}, \\quad \\frac{1+a}{2}, \\quad \\frac{1}{2}, \\ldots\n$$\n\nIn other words, $c_{i}=\\frac{1}{2}$ if $i$ is odd and $c_{i}=\\frac{1+a}{2}<C$ when $i$ is even. We claim Turbo must eventually visit all points on the circle. This is clear when it crawls in the same direction two times in a row; after all, we have $c_{i}+c_{i+1}>1$ for all $i$. Therefore, we are left with the case that Turbo alternates crawling clockwise and crawling counterclockwise. If it, without loss of generality, starts by going clockwise, then it will always crawl a distance $\\frac{1}{2}$ clockwise followed by a distance $\\frac{1+a}{2}$ counterclockwise. The net effect is that it crawls a distance $\\frac{a}{2}$ counterclockwise. Because $\\frac{a}{2}$ is positive, there exists a positive integer $N$ such that $\\frac{a}{2} \\cdot N>1$. After $2 N$ crawls, Turbo will have crawled a distance $\\frac{a}{2}$ counterclockwise $N$ times, therefore having covered a total distance of $\\frac{a}{2} \\cdot N>1$, meaning that it must have crawled over all points on the circle.\n\nNote: Every sequence of the form $c_{i}=x$ if $i$ is odd, and $c_{i}=y$ if $i$ is even, where $0<x, y<C$, such that $x+y \\geqslant 1$, and $x \\neq y$ satisfies the conditions with the same argument. There might be even more possible examples.", "To show that $C\\le \\frac12$\n\nWe consider the following related problem:\n\nWe assume instead that the snail Chet is moving left and right on the real line. Find the size $M$ of the smallest (closed) interval, that we cannot force Chet out of, using a sequence of real numbers $d_{i}$ with $0<d_{i}<1$ for all $i$.\n\nThen $C=1 / M$. Indeed if for every sequence $c_{1}, c_{2}, \\ldots$, with $c_{i}<C$ there exists a point that Turbo can avoid, then the circle can be cut open at the avoided point and mapped to an interval of size $M$ such that Chet can stay inside this interval for any sequence of the from $c_{1} / C, c_{2} / C, \\ldots$, see Figure 5 . However, all sequences $d_{1}, d_{2}, \\ldots$ with $d_{i}<1$ can be written in this form. Similarly if for every sequence $d_{1}, d_{2}, \\ldots$, there exists an interval of length smaller or equal $M$ that we cannot force Chet out of, this projects to a subset of the circle, that we cannot force Turbo out of using any sequence of the form $d_{1} / M, d_{2} / M, \\ldots$. These are again exactly all the sequences with elements in $[0, C)$.\n\n<img_3381>\n\nFigure 5: Chet and Turbo equivalence\n\nClaim: $M \\geqslant 2$.\n\nProof. Suppose not, so $M<2$. Say $M=2-2 \\varepsilon$ for some $\\varepsilon>0$ and let $[-1+\\varepsilon, 1-\\varepsilon]$ be a minimal interval, that Chet cannot be forced out of. Then we can force Chet arbitrarily close to $\\pm(1-\\varepsilon)$. In partiular, we can force Chet out of $\\left[-1+\\frac{4}{3} \\varepsilon, 1-\\frac{4}{3} \\varepsilon\\right]$ by minimality of $M$. This means that there exists a sequence $d_{1}, d_{2}, \\ldots$ for which Chet has to leave $\\left[-1+\\frac{4}{3} \\varepsilon, 1-\\frac{4}{3} \\varepsilon\\right]$, which means he ends up either in the interval $\\left[-1+\\varepsilon,-1+\\frac{4}{3} \\varepsilon\\right)$ or in the interval $\\left(1-\\frac{4}{3} \\varepsilon, 1-\\varepsilon\\right]$.\n\nNow consider the sequence,\n\n$$\nd_{1}, 1-\\frac{7}{6} \\varepsilon, 1-\\frac{2}{3} \\varepsilon, 1-\\frac{2}{3} \\varepsilon, 1-\\frac{7}{6} \\varepsilon, d_{2}, 1-\\frac{7}{6} \\varepsilon, 1-\\frac{2}{3} \\varepsilon, 1-\\frac{2}{3} \\varepsilon, 1-\\frac{7}{6} \\varepsilon, d_{3}, \\ldots\n$$\n\nobtained by adding the sequence $1-\\frac{7}{6} \\varepsilon, 1-\\frac{2}{3} \\varepsilon, 1-\\frac{2}{3} \\varepsilon, 1-\\frac{7}{6} \\varepsilon$ in between every two steps. We claim that this sequence forces Chet to leave the larger interval $[-1+\\varepsilon, 1-\\varepsilon]$. Indeed no two consecutive elements in the sequence $1-\\frac{7}{6} \\varepsilon, 1-\\frac{2}{3} \\varepsilon, 1-\\frac{2}{3} \\varepsilon, 1-\\frac{7}{6} \\varepsilon$ can have the same sign, because the sum of any two consecutive terms is larger than $2-2 \\varepsilon$ and Chet would leave the interval $[-1+\\varepsilon, 1-\\varepsilon]$. It follows that the $\\left(1-\\frac{7}{6} \\varepsilon\\right)$ 's and the $\\left(1-\\frac{2}{3} \\varepsilon\\right)$ 's cancel out, so the position after $d_{k}$ is the same as before $d_{k+1}$. Hence, the positions after each $d_{k}$ remain the same as in the original sequence. Thus, Chet is also forced to the boundary in the new sequence.\n\nIf Chet is outside the interval $\\left[-1+\\frac{4}{3} \\varepsilon, 1-\\frac{4}{3} \\varepsilon\\right]$, then Chet has to move $1-\\frac{7}{6} \\varepsilon$ towards 0 , and ends in $\\left[-\\frac{1}{6} \\varepsilon, \\frac{1}{6} \\varepsilon\\right]$. Chet then has to move by $1-\\frac{2}{3} \\varepsilon$, which means that he has to leave the interval $[-1+\\varepsilon, 1-\\varepsilon]$. Indeed the absolute value of the final position is at least $1-\\frac{5}{6} \\varepsilon$. This contradicts the assumption, that we cannot force Chet out of $[-1+\\varepsilon, 1-\\varepsilon]$. Hence $M \\geqslant 2$ as needed."]}, "target": "answer", "arguments": {"0": "until", "1": "max_new_tokens", "2": "temperature", "3": "top_p", "4": "num_beams", "5": "do_sample"}, "resps": [["To solve this problem, we need to determine the largest constant \\( C > 0 \\) such that for any sequence of positive real numbers \\( c_1, c_2, c_3, \\ldots \\) with \\( c_i < C \\) for all \\( i \\), Turbo can ensure that there is some point on the circle that it will never visit or crawl across.\n\nFirst, let's analyze the problem step by step.\n\n1. **Understanding the Problem:**\n   - The circle has a circumference of 1.\n   - Turbo starts at a point on the circle and crawls a distance \\( c_1 \\) in either direction.\n   - Turbo then crawls a distance \\( c_2 \\) in either direction, and so on.\n   - We need to find the largest \\( C \\) such that Turbo can always ensure that there is a point on the circle that it will never visit or crawl across.\n\n2. **Key Insight:**\n   - If \\( c_i \\) is very small, Turbo can potentially visit every point on the circle by carefully choosing the direction of each crawl.\n   - However, if \\( c_i \\) is too large, Turbo might not be able to avoid revisiting points or crawling across the entire circle.\n\n3. **Critical Value of \\( C \\):**\n   - If \\( C = 1 \\), then \\( c_i = 1 \\) for some \\( i \\).

Similarly, we can find that \\(S_5 = S_2 = 2\\), \\(S_6 = S_3 = 3\\), and so on. This pattern repeats every three sectors. Therefore, the numbers in the sectors are:\n\\[ S_1, S_2, S_3, S_1, S_2, S_3, \\ldots, S_1, S_2, S_3 \\]\nThe sum of the numbers in one complete cycle of three sectors is:\n\\[ S_1 + 2 + 3 = S_1 + 5 \\]\nSince there are 36 sectors, there are 12 complete cycles of three sectors. Therefore, the sum of all the numbers on the disc is:\n\\[ 12 \\cdot (S_1 + 5) \\]\nWe already know that \\(S_1 \\cdot 6 = P\\), and since the product of the numbers in any three consecutive sectors is the same, we can use the fact that the sum of the numbers in one complete cycle is the same. Let's denote the sum of the numbers in one complete cycle by \\(S\\). Then:\n\\[ S = S_1 + 2 + 3 = S_1 + 5 \\]\nSince the product of the numbers in any three consecutive sectors is the same, we can use the fact that the sum of the numbers in one complete cycle is the same. Therefore, the sum of all the numbers on the disc is:\n\\[ 12 \\cdot (S_1 + 5) \\]\nSince the product of the numbers in any three consecutive sectors is the same, we can use the fact that the sum of the numbers in one complete cycle is the same. Therefore, the sum of all the numbers on the disc is:\n\\[ 12 \\cdot (S_1 + 5) = 12 \\cdot 5 = 60 \\]\nSo the final answer is \\(\\boxed{60}\\)."], "doc_hash": "74234e98afe7498fb5daf1f36ac2d78acc339464f950703b8c019892f982b90b", "prompt_hash": "b57e223cf48c370f440d0344e2699731366f4c35e5541b3770055f7bc4f124f9", "target_hash": "0db52f4076c082518412afd3dd3576e2cb0c63703fd7fed5e23ade60efef31d9", "exact_match": 0, "input": "The following is a question from an International Algebra competition.\nA circular disc is divided into 36 sectors.

This gives us the following table:\n\n| $n$ | $f(n)$ |\n| :---: | :---: |\n| 3 | 3 |\n| 4 | 2 |\n| 5 | 5 |\n| 6 | 5 |\n| 7 | $?$ |\n| 8 | 10 |\n\nBased on this information, we make the guess that for every integer $n \\geq 6$, we have $f(n)=f(n-2)+f(n-3)$.\n\nFor example, this would mean that $f(7)=f(5)+f(4)=5+2=7$ which we can verify is true.\n\nBased on this recurrence relation (which we have yet to prove), we deduce the values of $f(n)$ up to and including $n=19$ :\n\n| $n$ | $f(n)$ | $n$ | $f(n)$ |\n| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |\n| 3 | 3 | 11 | 22 |\n| 4 | 2 | 12 | 29 |\n| 5 | 5 | 13 | 39 |\n| 6 | 5 | 14 | 51 |\n| 7 | 7 | 15 | 68 |\n| 8 | 10 | 16 | 90 |\n| 9 | 12 | 17 | 119 |\n| 10 | 17 | 18 | 158 |\n|  |  | 19 | 209 |\n\nWe now need to prove that the equation $f(n)=f(n-2)+f(n-3)$ is true for all $n \\geq 6$.\n\n\n\nWe think about each full table as a string of 0 s and 1s, with 1 representing a chair that is occupied and 0 representing an empty chair.\n\nLet $a(n)$ be the number of full tables with someone in seat 1 (and thus nobody in seat 2). Let $b(n)$ be the number of full tables with someone in seat 2 (and thus nobody in seat 1). Let $c(n)$ be the number of full tables with nobody in seat 1 or in seat 2 .\n\nSince every full table must be in one of these categories, then $f(n)=a(n)+b(n)+c(n)$. A full table with $n$ seats $n \\geq 4$ must correspond to a string that starts with 10,01 or 00 . Since there cannot be more than two consecutive 0s, we can further specify this, namely to say that a full table with $n$ seats must correspond to a string that starts with 1010 or 1001 or 0100 or 0101 or 0010 . In each case, these are the first 4 characters of the string and correspond to full (1) and empty (0) chairs.\n\nConsider the full tables starting with 1010. Note that such strings end with 0 since the table is circular. Removing the 10 from positions 1 and 2 creates strings of length $n-2$ that begin 10. These strings will still correspond to a full table, and so there are $a(n-2)$ such strings. (We note that all possible strings starting 1010 of length $n$ will lead to all possible strings starting with 1010 of length $n-2$.)\n\nConsider the full tables starting with 1001. Note that such a string ends with 0 since the table is circular. Removing the 100 from positions 1, 2 and 3 creates strings of length $n-3$ that begin 10. (There must have been a 0 in position 5 after the 1 in position 4.) These strings will still correspond to full tables, and so there are $a(n-3)$ such strings. Consider the full tables starting with 0100 . Removing the 100 from positions 2,3 and 4 creates strings of length $n-3$ that begin 01 . (There must have been a 1 in position 5 after the 0 in position 4.) These strings will still correspond to full tables, and so there are $b(n-3)$ such strings.\n\nConsider the full tables starting with 0101. Removing the 01 from positions 3 and 4 creates strings of length $n-2$ that begin 01 . (The 1 in position 4 must have been followed by one or two 0s and so these strings maintains the desired properties.) These strings will still correspond to full tables, and so there are $b(n-2)$ such strings.\n\nConsider the full tables starting with 0010. These strings must begin with either 00100 or 00101.\n\nIf strings start 00100 , then they start 001001 and so we remove the 001 in positions 4,5 and 6 and obtain strings of length $n-3$ that start 001 (and thus start 00). There are $c(n-3)$ such strings.\n\nIf strings start 00101, we remove the 01 in positions 4 and 5 and obtain strings of length $n-2$ that start 001 (and thus start 00 ). There are $c(n-2)$ such strings.\n\nThese 6 cases and subcases count all strings counted by $f(n)$.\n\nTherefore,\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nf(n) & =a(n-2)+a(n-3)+b(n-3)+b(n-2)+c(n-3)+c(n-2) \\\\\n& =a(n-2)+b(n-2)+c(n-2)+a(n-3)+b(n-3)+c(n-3) \\\\\n& =f(n-2)+f(n-3)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nas required, which means that the number of different full tables when $n=19$ is 209 .", "Extending our approach from (b), the number of people seated at a full table with 19 chairs is at least $\\frac{19}{3}=6 \\frac{1}{3}$ and at most $\\frac{19}{2}=9 \\frac{1}{2}$.\n\nSince the number of people is an integer, there must be 7,8 or 9 people at the table, which means that the number of empty chairs is 12,11 or 10 , respectively.\n\n\n\nSuppose that there are 9 people and 9 gaps with a total of 10 empty chairs.\n\nIn this case, there is 1 gap with 2 empty chairs and 8 gaps with 1 empty chair.\n\nThere are 19 pairs of chairs in which we can put 2 people with a gap of 2 in between: $\\{1,4\\},\\{2,5\\}, \\ldots,\\{19,3\\}$.\n\nOnce we choose one of these pairs, the seat choice for the remaining 8 people is completely determined by placing people in every other chair.\n\nTherefore, there are 19 different full tables with 9 people.\n\nSuppose that there are 8 people and 8 gaps with a total of 11 empty chairs.\n\nIn this case, there are 3 gaps with 2 empty chairs and 5 gaps with 1 empty chair. There are 7 different circular orderings in which these 8 gaps can be arranged:\n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{lllllll}\n22211111 & 22121111 & 22112111 & 22111211 & 22111121 & 21212111 & 21211211\n\\end{array}\n$$\n\nWe note that \"22211111\" would be the same as, for example, \"11222111\" since these gaps are arranged around a circle.\n\nIf the three gaps of length 2 are consecutive, there is only one configuration (22211111). If there are exactly 2 consecutive gaps of length 2 , there are 4 relative places in which the third gap of length 2 can be placed.\n\nIf there are no consecutive gaps of length 2 , these gaps can either be separated by 1 gap each (21212111) with 3 gaps on the far side, or can be separated by 1 gap, 2 gaps, and 2 gaps (21211211). There is only one configuration for the gaps in this last situation.\n\nThere are 7 different circular orderings for these 8 gaps.\n\nEach of these 7 different orderings can be placed around the circle of 19 chairs in 19 different ways, because each can be started in 19 different places. Because 19 is prime, none of these orderings overlap.\n\nTherefore, there are $7 \\cdot 19=133$ different full tables with 8 people.\n\nSuppose that there are 7 people and 7 gaps with a total of 12 empty chairs.\n\nIn this case, there are 2 gaps with 1 empty chair and 5 gaps with 2 empty chairs.\n\nThe 2 gaps with 1 empty chair can be separated by 0 gaps with 2 empty chairs, 1 gap with 2 empty chairs, or 2 gaps with 2 empty chairs. Because the chairs are around a circle, if there were 3 , 4 or 5 gaps with 2 empty chairs between them, there would be 2,1 or 0 gaps going the other way around the circle.\n\nThis means that there are 3 different configurations for the gaps.\n\nEach of these configurations can be placed in 19 different ways around the circle of chairs.

This quadrilateral is a rectangle since $P N$ and $Q R$ are perpendicular to the two side planes of the original solid.\n\nThus, $N R$ equals the height of $\\triangle P M N$.\n\nJoin $M$ to the midpoint $T$ of $P N$.\n\nSince $\\triangle P M N$ is isosceles, then $M T$ is perpendicular to $P N$.\n\n<img_3305>\n\nSince $N T=\\frac{1}{2} P N=1$ and $\\angle P M N=90^{\\circ}$ and $\\angle T N M=45^{\\circ}$, then $\\triangle M T N$ is also right-angled and isosceles with $M T=T N=1$.\n\nTherefore, $N R=M T=1$ and so the volume of $A B C D P Q R N$ is $2 \\cdot 1+4=6$.\n\nThe volumes of solids $P M Q A$ and $N M R B$ are equal. Each has height 2 and their bases $\\triangle P M Q$ and $\\triangle N M R$ are congruent, because each is right-angled (at $Q$ and at $R$ ) with $P Q=N R=1$ and $Q M=M R=1$.\n\nThus, using the formula above, the volume of each is $\\frac{1}{3}\\left(\\frac{1}{2}(1)(1)\\right) 2=\\frac{1}{3}$.\n\nFinally, the volume of the original solid equals $6-2 \\cdot \\frac{1}{3}=\\frac{16}{3}$.", "We determine the volume of $A B C D P M N$ by splitting it into two solids: $A B C D P N$ and $A B N P M$ by slicing along the plane of $A B N P$.\n\nSolid $A B C D P N$ is a triangular prism, since $\\triangle B C N$ and $\\triangle A D P$ are each right-angled (at $C$ and $D$ ), $B C=C N=A D=D P=2$, and segments $P N, D C$ and $A B$ are perpendicular to each of the triangular faces and equal in length.\n\nThus, the volume of $A B C D P N$ equals the area of $\\triangle B C N$ times the length of $D C$, or $\\frac{1}{2}(B C)(C N)(D C)=\\frac{1}{2}(2)(2)(2)=4$. (This solid can also be viewed as \"half\" of a cube.)\n\nSolid $A B N P M$ is a pyramid with rectangular base $A B N P$. (Note that $P N$ and $A B$ are perpendicular to the planes of both of the side triangular faces of the original solid, that $P N=A B=2$ and $B N=A P=\\sqrt{2^{2}+2^{2}}=2 \\sqrt{2}$, by the Pythagorean Theorem.)\n\nTherefore, the volume of $A B N P M$ equals $\\frac{1}{3}(A B)(B N) h=\\frac{4 \\sqrt{2}}{3} h$, where $h$ is the height of the pyramid (that is, the distance that $M$ is above plane $A B N P$ ).\n\nSo we need to calculate $h$.\n\nJoin $M$ to the midpoint, $T$, of $P N$ and to the midpoint, $S$, of $A B$. Join $S$ and $T$. By symmetry, $M$ lies directly above $S T$. Since $A B N P$ is a rectangle and $S$ and $T$ are the midpoints of opposite sides, then $S T=A P=2 \\sqrt{2}$.\n\nSince $\\triangle P M N$ is right-angled and isosceles, then $M T$ is perpendicular to $P N$. Since $N T=\\frac{1}{2} P N=1$ and $\\angle T N M=45^{\\circ}$, then $\\triangle M T N$ is also right-angled and isosceles with $M T=T N=1$.\n\n<img_3858>\n\nAlso, $M S$ is the hypotenuse of the triangle formed by dropping a perpendicular from $M$ to $U$ in the plane of $A B C D$ (a distance of 2) and joining $U$ to $S$. Since $M$ is 1 unit horizontally from $P N$, then $U S=1$.\n\nThus, $M S=\\sqrt{2^{2}+1^{2}}=\\sqrt{5}$ by the Pythagorean Theorem.\n\n<img_3846>\n\nWe can now consider $\\triangle S M T . h$ is the height of this triangle, from $M$ to base $S T$.\n\n<img_3680>\n\nNow $h=M T \\sin (\\angle M T S)=\\sin (\\angle M T S)$.\n\nBy the cosine law in $\\triangle S M T$, we have\n\n$$\nM S^{2}=S T^{2}+M T^{2}-2(S T)(M T) \\cos (\\angle M T S)\n$$\n\nTherefore, $5=8+1-4 \\sqrt{2} \\cos (\\angle M T S)$ or $4 \\sqrt{2} \\cos (\\angle M T S)=4$.\n\nThus, $\\cos (\\angle M T S)=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}$ and so $\\angle M T S=45^{\\circ}$ which gives $h=\\sin (\\angle M T S)=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}$.\n\n(Alternatively, we note that the plane of $A B C D$ is parallel to the plane of $P M N$, and so since the angle between plane $A B C D$ and plane $P N B A$ is $45^{\\circ}$, then the angle between plane $P N B A$ and plane $P M N$ is also $45^{\\circ}$, and so $\\angle M T S=45^{\\circ}$.)\n\nFinally, this means that the volume of $A B N P M$ is $\\frac{4 \\sqrt{2}}{3} \\cdot \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}=\\frac{4}{3}$, and so the volume of solid $A B C D P M N$ is $4+\\frac{4}{3}=\\frac{16}{3}$."]}, "target": "answer", "arguments": {"0": "until", "1": "max_new_tokens", "2": "temperature", "3": "top_p", "4": "num_beams", "5": "do_sample"}, "resps": [["To determine the volume of the convex solid \\(ABCDPMN\\), we need to analyze the given geometric configuration and calculate the volume step by step.\n\n1. **Identify the dimensions and the shape of the solid:**\n   - \\(ABCD\\) and \\(PNCD\\) are squares of side length 2.\n   - \\(PNCD\\) is perpendicular to \\(ABCD\\).\n   - Point \\(M\\) is chosen such that \\(\\triangle PMN\\) is parallel to \\(ABCD\\) and \\(\\angle PMN = 90^\\circ\\), and \\(PM = MN\\).\n\n2. **Determine the coordinates of the points:**\n   - Place \\(A\\) at \\((0, 0, 0)\\), \\(B\\) at \\((2, 0, 0)\\), \\(C\\) at \\((2, 2, 0)\\), and \\(D\\) at \\((0, 2, 0)\\).\n   - Since \\(PNCD\\) is perpendicular to \\(ABCD\\) and is a square of side length 2, place \\(P\\) at \\((0, 0, 2)\\), \\(N\\) at \\((2, 0, 2)\\), and \\(D\\) at \\((0, 2, 2)\\).\n\n3. **Determine the coordinates of \\(M\\):**\n   - Since \\(\\triangle PMN\\) is a right triangle with \\(\\angle PMN = 90^\\circ\\) and \\(PM = MN\\), \\(M\\) must be the midpoint of the hypotenuse of the right triangle formed by \\(P\\), \\(M\\), and \\(N\\).\n   - The coordinates of \\(M\\) can be found by noting that \\(M\\) is the midpoint of the line segment joining the projections of \\(P\\) and \\(N\\) on the plane \\(ABCD\\).

(Here, $p_{1}$ can equal 0 or 1.)\n\nThese strings are all of the form $p_{1} p_{2} p_{3} \\cdots p_{n-1} 0$.\n\nIn this case, since a 1 is always followed by a 0 and the strings end with 0 , we can build these strings using blocks of the form 10 and 0 . Any combination of these blocks will be an allowable string, as each 1 will always be both preceded and followed by a 0 .\n\nThus, these strings can all be built using $k 10$ blocks and $n-2 k 0$ blocks. This gives $k$ 1 's and $k+(n-2 k)=n-k 0$ 's. Note that any string built with these blocks will be allowable and will end with a 0 , and any such allowable string can be built in this way.\n\nThe number of ways of arranging $k$ blocks of one kind and $n-2 k$ blocks of another kind is $\\left(\\begin{array}{c}k+(n-2 k) \\\\ k\\end{array}\\right)$, which simplifies to $\\left(\\begin{array}{c}n-k \\\\ k\\end{array}\\right)$.\n\nConsider next the case when $p_{n}=1$.\n\nHere, we must have $p_{n-1}=p_{1}=0$, since these are the two digits adjacent to $p_{n}$.\n\nThus, these strings are all of the form $0 p_{2} p_{3} \\cdots 01$.\n\nConsider the strings formed by removing the first and last digits.\n\nThese strings are allowable, are of length $n-2$, include $k-11$ 's, end with 0 , and can begin with 0 or 1 .\n\nAgain, since a 1 is always followed by a 0 and the strings end with 0 , we can build these strings using blocks of the form 10 and 0 . Any combination of these blocks will be an allowable string, as each 1 will always be both preceded and followed by a 0 .\n\nTranslating our method of counting from the first case, there are $\\left(\\begin{array}{c}(n-2)-(k-1) \\\\ k-1\\end{array}\\right)$ or\n\n\n\n$\\left(\\begin{array}{c}n-k-1 \\\\ k-1\\end{array}\\right)$ such strings.\n\nThus, $f(n, k)=\\left(\\begin{array}{c}n-k \\\\ k\\end{array}\\right)+\\left(\\begin{array}{c}n-k-1 \\\\ k-1\\end{array}\\right)$ such strings.\n\nIn order to look at divisibility, we need to first simplify the formula:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nf(n, k) & =\\left(\\begin{array}{c}\nn-k \\\\\nk\n\\end{array}\\right)+\\left(\\begin{array}{c}\nn-k-1 \\\\\nk-1\n\\end{array}\\right) \\\\\n& =\\frac{(n-k) !}{k !(n-k-k) !}+\\frac{(n-k-1) !}{(k-1) !((n-k-1)-(k-1)) !} \\\\\n& =\\frac{(n-k) !}{k !(n-2 k) !}+\\frac{(n-k-1) !}{(k-1) !(n-2 k) !} \\\\\n& =\\frac{(n-k-1) !(n-k)}{k !(n-2 k) !}+\\frac{(n-k-1) ! k}{k !(n-2 k) !} \\\\\n& =\\frac{(n-k-1) !(n-k+k)}{k !(n-2 k) !} \\\\\n& =\\frac{n(n-k-1) !}{k !(n-2 k) !} \\\\\n& =\\frac{n(n-k-1)(n-k-2) \\cdots(n-2 k+2)(n-2 k+1)}{k !}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nNow that we have written $f(n, k)$ as a product, it is significantly easier to look at divisibility.\n\nNote that $2009=41 \\times 49=7^{2} \\times 41$, so we need $f(n, k)$ to be divisible by 41 and by 7 twice. For this to be the case, the numerator of $f(n, k)$ must have at least one more factor of 41 and at least two more factors of 7 than the denominator.\n\nAlso, we want to minimize $n+k$, so we work to keep $n$ and $k$ as small as possible.\n\nIf $n=49$ and $k=5$, then\n\n$$\nf(49,5)=\\frac{49(43)(42)(41)(40)}{5 !}=\\frac{49(43)(42)(41)(40)}{5(4)(3)(2)(1)}=49(43)(14)\n$$\n\nwhich is divisible by 2009 .\n\nWe show that this pair minimizes the value of $n+k$ with a value of 54 .\n\nWe consider the possible cases by looking separately at the factors of 41 and 7 that must occur. We focus on the factor of 41 first.\n\nFor the numerator to contain a factor of 41 , either $n$ is divisible by 41 or one of the terms in the product $(n-k-1)(n-k-2) \\cdots(n-2 k+1)$ is divisible by 41 .\n\nCase 1: $n$ is divisible by 41\n\nWe already know that $n=82$ is too large, so we consider $n=41$. From the original interpretation of $f(n, k)$, we see that $k \\leq 20$, as there can be no more than 20 gifts placed on 41 plates.\n\nHere, the numerator becomes 41 times the product of $k-1$ consecutive integers, the largest of which is $40-k$.\n\nNow the numerator must also contain at least two factors of 7 more than the denominator. But the denominator is the product of $k$ consecutive integers. Since the numerator contains the product of $k-1$ consecutive integers and the denominator contains the product of $k$ consecutive integers, then the denominator will always include at least as many multiples of 7 as the numerator (since there are more consecutive integers in the product in the denominator). Thus, it is impossible for the numerator to contain even one more\n\n\n\nadditional factor of 7 than the denominator.\n\nTherefore, if $n=41$, then $f(n, k)$ cannot be divisible by 2009 .\n\nCase 2: $n$ is not divisible by 41\n\nThis means that the factor of 41 in the numerator must occur in the product\n\n$$\n(n-k-1)(n-k-2) \\cdots(n-2 k+1)\n$$\n\nIn this case, the integer 41 must occur in this product, since an occurrence of 82 would make $n$ greater than 82 , which does not minimize $n+k$.\n\nSo we try to find values of $n$ and $k$ that include the integer 41 in this list.\n\nNote that $n-k-1$ is the largest factor in the product and $n-2 k+1$ is the smallest.\n\nSince 41 is contained somewhere in the product, then $n-2 k+1 \\leq 41$ (giving $n \\leq 40+2 k$ ) and $41 \\leq n-k-1$ (giving $n \\geq 42+k$ ).\n\nCombining these restrictions, we get $42+k \\leq n \\leq 40+2 k$.\n\nNow, we focus on the factors of 7 .\n\nEither $n$ is not divisible by 7 or $n$ is divisible by 7 .\n\n* If $n$ is not divisible by 7 , then at least two factors of 7 must be included in the product\n\n$$\n(n-k-1)(n-k-2) \\cdots(n-2 k+1)\n$$\n\nwhich means that either $k \\geq 8$ (to give two multiples of 7 in this list of $k-1$ consecutive integers) or one of the factors is divisible by 49 .\n\n- If $k \\geq 8$, then $n \\geq 42+k \\geq 50$ so $n+k \\geq 58$, which is not minimal.\n- If one of the factors is a multiple of 49 , then 49 must be included in the list so $n-2 k+1 \\leq 49$ (giving $n \\leq 48+2 k$ ) and $49 \\leq n-k-1$ (giving $n \\geq 50+k$ ). In this case, we already know that $42+k \\leq n \\leq 40+2 k$ and now we also have $50+k \\leq n \\leq 48+2 k$.\n\nFor these ranges to overlap, we need $50+k \\leq 40+2 k$ and so $k \\geq 10$, which means that $n \\geq 50+k \\geq 60$, and so $n+k \\geq 70$, which is not minimal.\n\n* Next, we consider the case where $n$ is a multiple of 7 .\n\nHere, $42+k \\leq n \\leq 40+2 k$ (to include 41 in the product) and $n$ is a multiple of 7 .\n\nSince $k$ is at least 2 by definition, then $n \\geq 42+k \\geq 44$, so $n$ is at least 49 .\n\nIf $n$ was 56 or more, we do not get a minimal value for $n+k$.\n\nThus, we need to have $n=49$. In this case, we do not need to look for another factor of 7 in the list.\n\nTo complete this case, we need to find the smallest value of $k$ for which 49 is in the range from $42+k$ to $40+2 k$ because we need to have $42+k \\leq n \\leq 40+2 k$.\n\nThis value of $k$ is $k=5$, which gives $n+k=49+5=54$.\n\nSince $f(49,5)$ is divisible by 2009 , as determined above, then this is the case that minimizes $n+k$, giving a value of 54 ."]}, "target": "answer", "arguments": {"0": "until", "1": "max_new_tokens", "2": "temperature", "3": "top_p", "4": "num_beams", "5": "do_sample"}, "resps": [["To solve the problem, we need to determine the smallest possible value of \\( n + k \\) such that \\( f(n, k) \\) is a positive multiple of 2009, where \\( f(n, k) \\) is the number of ways to place \\( k \\) gifts on \\( n \\) plates such that no two neighboring plates have gifts.\n\nFirst, we need to understand the function \\( f(n, k) \\).

To compute its volume, divide it into two square-based pyramids with edges of length 1 . Such a pyramid has slant height $\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}$ and height $\\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\right)^{2}-\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^{2}}=\\sqrt{\\frac{1}{2}}=\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}$, so its volume is $\\frac{1}{3} \\cdot 1^{2} \\cdot \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}=\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{6}$. Thus the octahedron has volume twice that, or $\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{3}$. The result of folding the net shown is actually the image of a regular octahedron after being stretched along an axis perpendicular to one face by a factor of $r$. Because the octahedron is only being stretched in one dimension, the volume changes by the same factor $r$. So the problem reduces to computing the factor $r$ and the edge length of the resulting octahedron.\n\nFor convenience, imagine that one face of the octahedron rests on a plane. Seen from above the plane, the octahedron appears as shown below.\n\n\n\n<img_3368>\n\nLet $P$ be the projection of $A$ onto the plane on which the octahedron rests, and let $Q$ be the foot of the perpendicular from $P$ to $\\overline{B C}$. Then $P Q=R_{C}-R_{I}$, where $R_{C}$ is the circumradius and $R_{I}$ the inradius of the equilateral triangle. Thus $P Q=\\frac{2}{3}\\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\right)-\\frac{1}{3}\\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\right)=\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{6}$. Then $B P^{2}=P Q^{2}+B Q^{2}=\\frac{3}{36}+\\frac{1}{4}=\\frac{1}{3}$, so $A P^{2}=A B^{2}-B P^{2}=\\frac{2}{3}$, and $A P=\\frac{\\sqrt{6}}{3}$.\n\nNow let a vertical stretch take place along an axis parallel to $\\overleftrightarrow{A P}$. If the scale factor is $r$, then $A P=\\frac{r \\sqrt{6}}{3}$, and because the stretch occurs on an axis perpendicular to $\\overline{B P}$, the length $B P$ is unchanged, as can be seen below.\n\n<img_3791>\n\nThus $A B^{2}=\\frac{6 r^{2}}{9}+\\frac{1}{3}=\\frac{6 r^{2}+3}{9}$. It remains to compute $r$.

The two rings are connected by the edges $E=\\left\\{A_{1} B_{1}, A_{2} B_{2}, \\ldots, A_{6} B_{6}\\right\\}$. Each vertex in the figure has exactly three edges joining it with the neighboring vertices. Also note that any closed loop must use exactly two edges (out of three) for each vertex.\n\nFurther note that a loop must use at least one edge from $E$ to move from one ring to the other. Consider two cases: the loop uses all six edges from $E$, or it uses some but not all of them.\n\nIf all edges from $E$ are used, there are two possible undirected loops. It is not possible to use both edges $A_{1} A_{2}$ and $B_{1} B_{2}$, so either $A_{1} A_{2}$ or $B_{1} B_{2}$ will be used. This choice determines how the entire loop is constructed.\n\nIf not all edges from $E$ are used, then there must be some $i$ for which the loop uses the edge $A_{i} B_{i}$ and does not use $A_{i+1} B_{i+1}$ (where $A_{j} B_{j}$ represents $A_{j-6} B_{j-6}$ if $7 \\leq j \\leq 12$ ). Because $A_{i+1}$ is only connected to three other vertices, the loop must use $A_{i} A_{i+1}$ and $A_{i+1} A_{i+2}$, and similarly must use $B_{i} B_{i+1}$ and $B_{i+1} B_{i+2}$. This also precludes using $A_{i+2} B_{i+2}$, because doing so would close the loop before it visits all 12 vertices. Therefore the loop must also use $A_{i+2} A_{i+3}$ and $B_{i+2} B_{i+3}$, which now precludes using $A_{i+3} B_{i+3}$. This continues to force the structure of the loop until it closes by using $A_{i+5} B_{i+5}=A_{i-1} B_{i-1}$. Hence the loop must use exactly two edges from $E$, and they must be consecutive: $A_{i-1} B_{i-1}$ and $A_{i} B_{i}$. There are 6 ways to choose those two consecutive edges, so there are 6 possible undirected loops in this case.\n\nThe forced path is a loop, and the only way the given conditions are satisfied if $A_{i+k}=A_{i-1}$ and $B_{i+k}=B_{i-1}$. Hence the loop must use (precisely) two consecutive edges from $E: A_{i-1} B_{i-1}$ and $A_{i} B_{i}$.

After robbing a bank, the Robber retreats to a network of hideouts, represented by dots in the diagram below. Every day, the Robber stays holed up in a single hideout, and every night, the Robber moves to an adjacent hideout. Two hideouts are adjacent if and only if they are connected by an edge in the diagram, also called a hideout map (or map). For the purposes of this Power Question, the map must be connected; that is, given any two hideouts, there must be a path from one to the other. To clarify, the Robber may not stay in the same hideout for two consecutive days, although he may return to a hideout he has previously visited. For example, in the map below, if the Robber holes up in hideout $C$ for day 1 , then he would have to move to $B$ for day 2 , and would then have to move to either $A, C$, or $D$ on day 3.\n\n<image_1>\n\nEvery day, each Cop searches one hideout: the Cops know the location of all hideouts and which hideouts are adjacent to which. Cops are thorough searchers, so if the Robber is present in the hideout searched, he is found and arrested. If the Robber is not present in the hideout searched, his location is not revealed. That is, the Cops only know that the Robber was not caught at any of the hideouts searched; they get no specific information (other than what they can derive by logic) about what hideout he was in. Cops are not constrained by edges on the map: a Cop may search any hideout on any day, regardless of whether it is adjacent to the hideout searched the previous day. A Cop may search the same hideout on consecutive days, and multiple Cops may search different hideouts on the same day. In the map above, a Cop could search $A$ on day 1 and day 2, and then search $C$ on day 3 .\n\nThe focus of this Power Question is to determine, given a hideout map and a fixed number of Cops, whether the Cops can be sure of catching the Robber within some time limit.\n\nMap Notation: The following notation may be useful when writing your solutions. For a map $M$, let $h(M)$ be the number of hideouts and $e(M)$ be the number of edges in $M$. The safety of a hideout $H$ is the number of hideouts adjacent to $H$, and is denoted by $s(H)$.\n\nThe Cop number of a map $M$, denoted $C(M)$, is the minimum number of Cops required to guarantee that the Robber is caught.\nFind $C(M)$ for the map below.\n\n<image_2>", "final_answer": ["6"], "is_multiple_answer": false, "unit": null, "answer_type": "Numerical", "error": null, "source": "OE_MM_maths_en_COMP", "solution": ["First we prove that for all maps $M, C(M)<h(M)$.\n\nProve.

Choose any subset $\\mathcal{S}$ of $n-1$ hideouts and position $n-1$ Cops at the hideouts of $\\mathcal{S}$ for 2 days.

The safety of a hideout $H$ is the number of hideouts adjacent to $H$, and is denoted by $s(H)$.\n\nThe Cop number of a map $M$, denoted $C(M)$, is the minimum number of Cops required to guarantee that the Robber is caught.\n\n\nThe police want to catch the Robber with a minimum number of Cops, but time is of the essence. For a map $M$ and a fixed number of Cops $c \\geq C(M)$, define the capture time, denoted $D(M, c)$, to be the minimum number of days required to guarantee a capture using $c$ Cops. For example, in the graph below, if three Cops are deployed, they might catch the Robber in the first day, but if they don't, there is a strategy that will guarantee they will capture the Robber within two days. Therefore the capture time is $D\\left(\\mathcal{C}_{6}, 3\\right)=2$.\n\n<image_2>\nDefinition: The workday number of $M$, denoted $W(M)$, is the minimum number of Cop workdays needed to guarantee the Robber's capture. For example, a strategy that guarantees capture within three days using 17 Cops on the first day, 11 Cops on the second day, and only 6 Cops on the third day would require a total of $17+11+6=34$ Cop workdays.\n\nDetermine $W(M)$ for each of the maps in figure a and figure b.\n<image_3>\nfigure a\n\n<image_4>\nfigure b", "final_answer": ["12, 8"], "is_multiple_answer": true, "unit": null, "answer_type": "Numerical", "error": null, "source": "OE_MM_maths_en_COMP", "solution": ["or the map $M$ from figure a, $W(M)=7$. The most efficient strategy is to use 7 Cops to blanket all the hideouts on the first day. Any strategy using fewer than 7 Cops would require 6 Cops on each of two consecutive days: given that any hideout can be reached from any other hideout, leaving more than one hideout unsearched on one day makes it is impossible to eliminate any hideouts the following day. So any other strategy would require a minimum of 12 Cop workdays.\n\nFor the map $M$ from figure b, $W(M)=8$. The strategy outlined in $2 \\mathrm{~b}$ used three Cops for a maximum of four workdays, yielding 12 Cop workdays. The most efficient strategy is to use 4 Cops, positioned at $\\{B, E, H, K\\}$ for 2 days each. The following argument demonstrates that 8 Cop workdays is in fact minimal. First, notice that there is no advantage to searching one of the hideouts between vertices of the square (for example, $C$ ) without searching the other hideout between the same vertices (for example, $D$ ). The Robber can reach $C$ on day $n$ if and only if he is at either $B$ or $E$ on day $n-1$, and in either case he could just as well go to $D$ instead of $C$. So there is no situation in which the Robber is certain to be caught at $C$ rather than at $D$. Additionally, the Robber's possible locations on day $n+1$ are the same whether he is at $C$ or $D$ on day $n$, so searching one rather than the other fails to rule out any locations for future days. So any successful strategy that involves searching $C$ should also involve searching $D$ on the same day, and similarly for $F$ and $G, I$ and $J$, and $L$ and $A$. On the other hand, if the Robber must be at one of $C$ and $D$ on day $n$, then he must be at either $B$ or $E$ on day $n+1$, because those are the only adjacent hideouts. So any strategy that involves searching both hideouts of one of the off-the-square pairs on day $n$ is equivalent to a strategy that searches the adjacent on-the-square hideouts on day $n+1$; the two strategies use the same number of Cops for the same number of workdays. Thus the optimal number of Cop workdays can be achieved using strategies that only search the \"corner\" hideouts $B, E, H, K$.\n\nRestricting the search to only those strategies searching corner hideouts $B, E, H, K$, a total of 8 workdays can be achieved by searching all four hideouts on two consecutive days: if the Robber is at one of the other eight hideouts the first day, he must move to one of the two adjacent corner hideouts the second day. But each of these corner hideouts is adjacent to two other corner hideouts. So if only one hideout is searched, for no matter how many consecutive days, the following day, the Robber could either be back at the previously-searched hideout or be at any other hideout: no possibilities are ruled out. If two adjacent corners are searched, the Cops do no better, as the following argument shows. Suppose that $B$ and $E$ are both searched for two consecutive days. Then the Cops can rule out $B, E, C$, and $D$ as possible locations, but if the Cops then switch to searching either $H$ or $K$ instead of $B$ or $E$, the Robber can go back to $C$ or $D$ within two days. So searching two adjacent corner hideouts for two days is fruitless and costs four Cop workdays. Searching diagonally opposite corner hideouts is even less fruitful, because doing so rules out none of the other hideouts as possible Robber locations. Using three Cops each day, it is easy to imagine scenarios in which the Robber evades capture for three days before being caught: for example, if $B, E, H$ are searched for two consecutive days, the Robber goes from $I$ or $J$ to $K$ to $L$. Therefore if three Cops are used, four days are required for a total of 12 Cop workdays.\n\nIf there are more than four Cops, the preceding arguments show that the number of Cops must be even to produce optimal results (because there is no advantage to searching one hideout between vertices of the square without searching the other). Using six Cops with four at corner hideouts yields no improvement, because the following day, the Robber could get to any of the four corner hideouts, requiring at least four Cops the second day, for ten Cop workdays. If two or fewer Cops are at corner hideouts, the situation is even worse, because if the Robber is not caught that day, he has at least nine possible hideouts the following day (depending on whether the unsearched corners are adjacent or diagonally opposite to each other). Using eight Cops (with four at corner vertices) could eliminate one corner vertex as a possible location for the second day (if the non-corner hideouts searched are on adjacent sides of the square), but eight Cop workdays have already been used on the first day. So 8 Cop workdays is minimal."]}, "target": "answer", "arguments": {"0": "until", "1": "max_new_tokens", "2": "temperature", "3": "top_p", "4": "num_beams", "5": "do_sample", "6": "max_tokens"}, "resps": [["To determine the workday number \\( W(M) \\) for each of the maps in figure a and figure b, we need to analyze the structure of the maps and the strategies required to catch the Robber.\n\n### Figure a\n\nThe map in figure a is a simple path graph with 4 vertices \\( A, B, C, D \\).

For example, in the graph below, if three Cops are deployed, they might catch the Robber in the first day, but if they don't, there is a strategy that will guarantee they will capture the Robber within two days. Therefore the capture time is $D\\left(\\mathcal{C}_{6}, 3\\right)=2$.\n\n<image_2>\nDefinition: The workday number of $M$, denoted $W(M)$, is the minimum number of Cop workdays needed to guarantee the Robber's capture.

Then $[B D G]=[D E G]=18$ because the triangles have equal bases and heights. Because $D, G$, and $F$ are collinear, to compute $[B G F]$ it suffices to find the ratio $D G / G F$.

If a mass of weight 1 is placed at vertex $B$ and masses of weight 2 are placed at vertices $A$ and $C$, then $\\triangle A B C$ balances on the line $\\overleftrightarrow{B F}$ and also on the line $\\overleftrightarrow{C E}$. Thus it balances on the point $H$ where these two lines intersect. Replacing the masses at $A$ and $C$ with a single mass of weight 4 at their center of mass $F$, the triangle still balances at $H$. Thus $B H / H F=4$.\n\nNext, consider $\\triangle B E F$. Placing masses of weight 1 at the vertices $B$ and $E$ and a mass of weight 4 at $F$, the triangle balances at $G$. A similar argument shows that $D G / G F=2$ and that $E G / G H=5$.

For example, $J=35214$ is a 5 -label and $K=132$ is a 3 -label. For a fixed positive integer $p$, where $p \\leq n$, consider consecutive blocks of $p$ numbers in an $n$-label. For example, when $p=3$ and $L=263415$, the blocks are 263,634,341, and 415. We can associate to each of these blocks a $p$-label that corresponds to the relative order of the numbers in that block.

For example, in the $p$-signature $(. ., 2143,2431, \\ldots), 2143$ and 2431 are compatible. Notice that the last three digits of 2143 and the first three digits of 2431 can be described by the same 3-label, 132 .\n\nTheorem: A signature $\\sigma$ is possible if and only if every pair of consecutive windows is compatible.\n\nProof: $(\\Rightarrow)$ Consider a signature $\\sigma$ describing a $p$-label $L$. If some pair in $\\sigma$ is not compatible, then there is some string of $p-1$ numbers in our label $L$ that has two different $(p-1)$-signatures. This is impossible, since the $p$-signature is well-defined.\n\n$(\\Leftarrow)$ Now suppose $\\sigma$ is a $p$-signature such that that every pair of consecutive windows is compatible. We need to show that there is at least one label $L$ with $S_{p}[L]=\\sigma$. We do so by induction on the number of windows in $\\sigma$, using the results from $5(\\mathrm{~b})$.\n\nLet $\\sigma=\\left\\{\\omega_{1}, \\omega_{2}, \\ldots, \\omega_{k+1}\\right\\}$, and suppose $\\omega_{1}=a_{1}, a_{2}, \\ldots, a_{p}$. Set $L_{1}=\\omega_{1}$.\n\nSuppose that $L_{k}$ is a $(p+k-1)$-label such that $S_{p}\\left[L_{k}\\right]=\\left\\{\\omega_{1}, \\ldots, \\omega_{k}\\right\\}$. We will construct $L_{k+1}$ for which $S_{p}\\left[L_{k+1}\\right]=\\left\\{\\omega_{1}, \\ldots, \\omega_{k+1}\\right\\}$.\n\nAs in $5(\\mathrm{~b})$, denote by $L_{k}^{(j)}$ the label $L_{k}$ with a $j+0.5$ appended; we will eventually renumber the elements in the label to make them all integers. Appending $j+0.5$ does not affect any of the non-terminal windows of $S_{p}\\left[L_{k}\\right]$, and as $j$ varies from 0 to $p-k+1$ the final window of $S_{p}\\left[L_{k}^{(j)}\\right]$ varies over each of the $p$ windows compatible with $\\omega_{k}$. Since $\\omega_{k+1}$ is compatible with $\\omega_{k}$, there exists some $j$ for which $S_{p}\\left[L_{k}^{(j)}\\right]=\\left\\{\\omega_{1}, \\ldots, \\omega_{k+1}\\right\\}$. Now we renumber as follows: set $L_{k+1}=S_{k+p}\\left[L_{k}^{(j)}\\right]$, which replaces $L_{k}^{(j)}$ with the integers 1 through $k+p$ and preserves the relative order of all integers in the label.\n\nBy continuing this process, we conclude that the $n$-label $L_{n-p+1}$ has $p$-signature $\\sigma$, so $\\sigma$ is possible.\n\nTo count the number of possible $p$-signatures, we choose the first window ( $p$ ! choices), then choose each of the remaining $n-p$ compatible windows ( $p$ choices each).

That is, the distance between them in the $n$-label is less than $p$.\n\nProof: Suppose that for some $k$, the distance between $k$ and $k+1$ is $p$ or greater. Then the label $L^{\\prime}$ obtained by swapping $k$ and $k+1$ has the same $p$-signature, because there are no numbers between $k$ and $k+1$ in any window and because the two numbers never appear in the same window.\n\nIf the distance between all such pairs is less than $k$, we need to show that $S_{p}[L]$ is unique. For $i=1,2, \\ldots, n$, let $r_{i}$ denote the position where $i$ appears in $L$. For example, if $L=4123$, then $r_{1}=2, r_{2}=3, r_{3}=4$, and $r_{4}=1$.\n\nLet $L=a_{1}, a_{2}, \\ldots, a_{n}$. Since 1 and 2 are in some window together, $a_{r_{1}}<a_{r_{2}}$. Similarly, for any $k$, since $k$ and $k+1$ are in some window together, $a_{r_{k}}<a_{r_{k+1}}$.

Therefore, $S_{p}[L]$ is unique.\n\nFrom the proof above, we know that the signature is unique if and only if every pair of consecutive integers coexists in at least one window.

Using this vocabulary, the problem's condition is that every pair of neighbors must be friends of each other. Each of the numbers 1 and 8 has two friends, and each number has at most four friends.\n\nIf there is no number written in the center square, then we must have one of the cycles in the figures below. For each cycle, there are 8 rotations. Thus there are 16 possible configurations with no number written in the center square.\n\n| 2 | 1 | 3 |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| 4 | - | 5 |\n| 6 | 8 | 7 |\n\n\n| 3 | 1 | 2 |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| 5 | - | 4 |\n| 7 | 8 | 6 |\n\nNow assume that the center square contains the number $n$. Because $n$ has at least three neighbors, $n \\neq 1$ and $n \\neq 8$. First we show that 1 must be in a corner. If 1 is a neighbor of $n$, then one of the corners neighboring 1 must be empty, because 1 has only two friends ( 2 and $3)$. If $c$ is in the other corner neighboring 1 , then $\\{n, c\\}=\\{2,3\\}$. But then $n$ must have three\n\n\n\nmore friends $\\left(n_{1}, n_{2}, n_{3}\\right)$ other than 1 and $c$, for a total of five friends, which is impossible, as illustrated below. Therefore 1 must be in a corner.\n\n| - | 1 | $c$ |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| $n_{1}$ | $n$ | $n_{2}$ |\n|  | $n_{3}$ |  |\n\nNow we show that 1 can only have one neighbor, i.e., one of the squares adjacent to 1 is empty. If 1 has two neighbors, then we have, up to a reflection and a rotation, the configuration shown below. Because 2 has only one more friend, the corner next to 2 is empty and $n=4$. Consequently, $m_{1}=5$ (refer to the figure below). Then 4 has one friend (namely 6) left with two neighbors $m_{2}$ and $m_{3}$, which is impossible. Thus 1 must have exactly one neighbor. An analogous argument shows that 8 must also be at a corner with exactly one neighbor.\n\n| 1 | 2 | - |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| 3 | $n$ | $m_{3}$ |\n| $m_{1}$ | $m_{2}$ |  |\n\nTherefore, 8 and 1 must be in non-opposite corners, with the blank square between them. Thus, up to reflections and rotations, the only possible configuration is the one shown at left below.\n\n| 1 | - | 8 |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| $m$ |  |  |\n|  |  |  |\n\n\n| 1 | - | 8 |\n| :---: | :---: | :---: |\n| $2 / 3$ | $4 / 5$ | $6 / 7$ |\n| $3 / 2$ | $5 / 4$ | $7 / 6$ |\n\nThere are two possible values for $m$, namely 2 and 3 . For each of the cases $m=2$ and $m=3$, the rest of the configuration is uniquely determined, as illustrated in the figure above right. We summarize our process: there are four corner positions for 1; two (non-opposite) corner positions for 8 (after 1 is placed); and two choices for the number in the square neighboring 1 but not neighboring 8 . This leads to $4 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 2=16$ distinct configurations with a number written in the center square.\n\nTherefore, there are 16 configurations in which the center square is blank and 16 configurations with a number in the center square, for a total of $\\mathbf{3 2}$ distinct configurations."]}, "target": "answer", "arguments": {"0": "until", "1": "max_new_tokens", "2": "temperature", "3": "top_p", "4": "num_beams", "5": "do_sample"}, "resps": [["To solve the problem, we need to place the numbers \\(1, 2, \\ldots, 8\\) in a \\(3 \\times 3\\) grid with exactly one blank square such that in every pair of adjacent squares, either one square is blank or the difference between the two numbers is at most 2.

The retained parts of the kingdom form two regions, each bordered by three arcs of circles; in what follows, we will call such regions curvilinear triangles, or $c$-triangles ( $\\mathrm{c} \\triangle$ ) for short.\n\nThis sad day marks day 0 of a new fiscal era. Unfortunately, these drastic measures are not enough, and so each day thereafter, court geometers mark off the largest possible circle contained in each c-triangle in the remaining property. This circle is tangent to all three arcs of the c-triangle, and will be referred to as the incircle of the c-triangle. At the end of the day, all incircles demarcated that day are sold off, and the following day, the remaining c-triangles are partitioned in the same manner.\n\nSome notation: when discussing mutually tangent circles (or arcs), it is convenient to refer to the curvature of a circle rather than its radius. We define curvature as follows. Suppose that circle $A$ of radius $r_{a}$ is externally tangent to circle $B$ of radius $r_{b}$. Then the curvatures of the circles are simply the reciprocals of their radii, $\\frac{1}{r_{a}}$ and $\\frac{1}{r_{b}}$. If circle $A$ is internally tangent to circle $B$, however, as in the right diagram below, the curvature of circle $A$ is still $\\frac{1}{r_{a}}$, while the curvature of circle $B$ is $-\\frac{1}{r_{b}}$, the opposite of the reciprocal of its radius.\n\n<image_1>\n\nCircle $A$ has curvature 2; circle $B$ has curvature 1 .\n\n<image_2>\n\nCircle $A$ has curvature 2; circle $B$ has curvature -1 .\n\nUsing these conventions allows us to express a beautiful theorem of Descartes: when four circles $A, B, C, D$ are pairwise tangent, with respective curvatures $a, b, c, d$, then\n\n$$\n(a+b+c+d)^{2}=2\\left(a^{2}+b^{2}+c^{2}+d^{2}\\right),\n$$\n\nwhere (as before) $a$ is taken to be negative if $B, C, D$ are internally tangent to $A$, and correspondingly for $b, c$, or $d$.\nWithout using Descartes' Circle Formula, Find the combined area of the six remaining curvilinear territories after day 1.", "final_answer": ["$\\frac{5 \\pi}{18}$"], "is_multiple_answer": false, "unit": null, "answer_type": "Numerical", "error": null, "source": "OE_MM_maths_en_COMP", "solution": ["The four \"removed\" circles have radii $\\frac{1}{2}, \\frac{1}{2}, \\frac{1}{3}, \\frac{1}{3}$ so the combined area of the six remaining curvilinear territories is:\n\n$$\n\\pi\\left(1^{2}-\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^{2}-\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^{2}-\\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right)^{2}-\\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right)^{2}\\right)=\\frac{5 \\pi}{18}\n$$"]}, "target": "answer", "arguments": {"0": "until", "1": "max_new_tokens", "2": "temperature", "3": "top_p", "4": "num_beams", "5": "do_sample"}, "resps": [["To solve the problem, we need to determine the combined area of the six remaining curvilinear territories after day 1.

The correct area of the intersection of two circles of radius \\( r \\) with a distance \\( d \\) between their centers is:\n\\[\nA = 2r^2 \\cos^{-1}\\left(\\frac{d}{2r}\\right) - \\frac{d}{2} \\sqrt{4r^2 - d^2}\n\\]\nFor our case:\n\\[\nA = 2 \\left( \\frac{1}{2} \\right)^2 \\cos^{-1}\\left(\\frac{1}{2 \\cdot \\frac{1}{2}}\\right) - \\frac{1}{2} \\sqrt{4 \\left( \\frac{1}{2} \\right)^2 - 1^2}\n\\]\n\\[\nA = 2 \\left( \\frac{1}{4} \\right) \\cos^{-1}(1) - \\frac{1}{2} \\sqrt{1 - 1}\n\\]\n\\[\nA = \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot 0 - \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot 0 = \\frac{\\pi}{8}\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Finding the Incircle of the Curvilinear Triangle\nThe incircle of the curvilinear triangle is the largest circle that can be inscribed in the triangle formed by the three arcs. The radius of the incircle can be found using the formula for the radius of the incircle of a triangle:\n\\[\nr = \\frac{A}{s}\n\\]\nwhere \\( A \\) is the area of the triangle and \\( s \\) is the semiperimeter. For a curvilinear triangle, the area and semiperimeter can be calculated using the properties of the circles and their tangency.\n\n### Step 4: Calculating the Area of the Incircle\nThe radius of the incircle is \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\). The area of the incircle is:\n\\[\n\\text{Area} = \\pi \\left( \\frac{1}{4} \\right)^2 = \\frac{\\pi}{16}\n\\]\n\n### Step 5: Calculating the Combined Area of the Six Remaining Curvilinear Territories\nSince there are two c-triangles, and each c-triangle has an incircle of area \\( \\frac{\\pi}{16} \\), the combined area of the six remaining curvilinear territories is:\n\\[\n6 \\times \\frac{\\pi}{16} = \\frac{6\\pi}{16} = \\frac{3\\pi}{8}\n\\]\n\nSo the final answer is \\(\\boxed{\\frac{3\\pi}{8}}\\)."], "doc_hash": "74234e98afe7498fb5daf1f36ac2d78acc339464f950703b8c019892f982b90b", "prompt_hash": "f58beebd81b87682bf083ab5be5521e9c34b4195b1c5fea5a3bf49c219ebdc4a", "target_hash": "0db52f4076c082518412afd3dd3576e2cb0c63703fd7fed5e23ade60efef31d9", "exact_match": 0, "input": "The following is a question from an International Geometry competition.\nA king strapped for cash is forced to sell off his kingdom $U=\\left\\{(x, y): x^{2}+y^{2} \\leq 1\\right\\}$.

If circle $A$ is internally tangent to circle $B$, however, as in the right diagram below, the curvature of circle $A$ is still $\\frac{1}{r_{a}}$, while the curvature of circle $B$ is $-\\frac{1}{r_{b}}$, the opposite of the reciprocal of its radius.\n\n<image_1>\n\nCircle $A$ has curvature 2; circle $B$ has curvature 1 .\n\n<image_2>\n\nCircle $A$ has curvature 2; circle $B$ has curvature -1 .\n\nUsing these conventions allows us to express a beautiful theorem of Descartes: when four circles $A, B, C, D$ are pairwise tangent, with respective curvatures $a, b, c, d$, then\n\n$$\n(a+b+c+d)^{2}=2\\left(a^{2}+b^{2}+c^{2}+d^{2}\\right),\n$$\n\nwhere (as before) $a$ is taken to be negative if $B, C, D$ are internally tangent to $A$, and correspondingly for $b, c$, or $d$.\nFind the areas of the circles removed on day 3.\nThe question has multiple answers, each of them should be Numerical.\nPlease calculate the answer according to the given requirements and the information provided.

question from an International Combinatorics competition.\nThe arrangement of numbers known as Pascal's Triangle has fascinated mathematicians for centuries. In fact, about 700 years before Pascal, the Indian mathematician Halayudha wrote about it in his commentaries to a then-1000-year-old treatise on verse structure by the Indian poet and mathematician Pingala, who called it the Meruprastāra, or \"Mountain of Gems\". In this Power Question, we'll explore some properties of Pingala's/Pascal's Triangle (\"PT\") and its variants.\n\nUnless otherwise specified, the only definition, notation, and formulas you may use for PT are the definition, notation, and formulas given below.\n\nPT consists of an infinite number of rows, numbered from 0 onwards. The $n^{\\text {th }}$ row contains $n+1$ numbers, identified as $\\mathrm{Pa}(n, k)$, where $0 \\leq k \\leq n$. For all $n$, define $\\mathrm{Pa}(n, 0)=\\operatorname{Pa}(n, n)=1$. Then for $n>1$ and $1 \\leq k \\leq n-1$, define $\\mathrm{Pa}(n, k)=\\mathrm{Pa}(n-1, k-1)+\\mathrm{Pa}(n-1, k)$. It is convenient to define $\\mathrm{Pa}(n, k)=0$ when $k<0$ or $k>n$. We write the nonzero values of $\\mathrm{PT}$ in the familiar pyramid shown below.\n\n<image_1>\n\nAs is well known, $\\mathrm{Pa}(n, k)$ gives the number of ways of choosing a committee of $k$ people from a set of $n$ people, so a simple formula for $\\mathrm{Pa}(n, k)$ is $\\mathrm{Pa}(n, k)=\\frac{n !}{k !(n-k) !}$. You may use this formula or the recursive definition above throughout this Power Question.\n\nClark's Triangle: If the left side of PT is replaced with consecutive multiples of 6 , starting with 0 , but the right entries (except the first) and the generating rule are left unchanged, the result is called Clark's Triangle. If the $k^{\\text {th }}$ entry of the $n^{\\text {th }}$ row is denoted by $\\mathrm{Cl}(n, k)$, then the formal rule is:\n\n$$\n\\begin{cases}\\mathrm{Cl}(n, 0)=6 n & \\text { for all } n \\\\ \\mathrm{Cl}(n, n)=1 & \\text { for } n \\geq 1 \\\\ \\mathrm{Cl}(n, k)=\\mathrm{Cl}(n-1, k-1)+\\mathrm{Cl}(n-1, k) & \\text { for } n \\geq 1 \\text { and } 1 \\leq k \\leq n-1\\end{cases}\n$$\n\nThe first four rows of Clark's Triangle are given below.\n\n<image_2>\nCompute $\\mathrm{Cl}(11,3)$.\nThe answer of the question should be Numerical.\nPlease calculate the answer according to the given requirements and the information provided. Please use LaTeX format to represent the variables and formulas used in the solution process and results. Please end your solution with \"So the final answer is \\boxed{answer}.\"\n"}

Proof: We can divide the sector into arbitrarily small sectors that can be approximated as isosceles triangles. It's well known that the center of mass of one such isosceles triangle is $\\frac{2}{3}$ of the way from the central vertex to the base. Therefore, the center of mass of the sector is the center of mass of the arc with central angle $\\frac{\\pi}{3}$ and same center with radius $\\frac{2}{3}$ contained within the sector. Since the center of mass has to lie on the axis of symmetry, we set that as the $\\mathrm{x}$ axis with the vertex of the sector being $x=0$.

The steeper the ramp, the faster the car will roll down. We need to calculate the velocity for each ramp.\n\n#### Ramp 1 (45°)\nThe car rolls down a 45° ramp. The velocity at the bottom can be calculated using the conservation of energy:\n\\[ mgh = \\frac{1}{2}mv^2 \\]\n\\[ v = \\sqrt{2gh} \\]\nSince \\(h = 1 \\, \\text{m}\\), the velocity is:\n\\[ v = \\sqrt{2 \\times 9.8 \\times 1} = \\sqrt{19.6} \\approx 4.43 \\, \\text{m/s} \\]\n\n#### Ramp 2 (60° and 30°)\nThe car rolls down a 60° and 30° ramp. The velocity at the bottom can be calculated using the conservation of energy:\n\\[ mgh = \\frac{1}{2}mv^2 \\]\n\\[ v = \\sqrt{2gh} \\]\nSince \\(h = 1 \\, \\text{m}\\), the velocity is:\n\\[ v = \\sqrt{2 \\times 9.8 \\times 1} = \\sqrt{19.6} \\approx 4.43 \\, \\text{m/s} \\]\n\n#### Ramp 3 (30° and 60°)\nThe car rolls down a 30° and 60° ramp. The velocity at the bottom can be calculated using the conservation of energy:\n\\[ mgh = \\frac{1}{2}mv^2 \\]\n\\[ v = \\sqrt{2gh} \\]\nSince \\(h = 1 \\, \\text{m}\\), the velocity is:\n\\[ v = \\sqrt{2 \\times 9.8 \\times 1} = \\sqrt{19.6} \\approx 4.43 \\, \\text{m/s} \\]\n\n### Step 6: Determine the Time to Reach the Bottom\nThe time \\(t\\) it takes for the car to reach the bottom of the ramp is given by:\n\\[ t = \\frac{d}{v} \\]\nSince the horizontal distance \\(d\\) is the same for all ramps (\\(1 \\, \\text{m}\\)) and the velocity \\(v\\) is the same for all ramps (\\(\\approx 4.43 \\, \\text{m/s}\\)), the time \\(t\\) is the same for all ramps.\n\n### Conclusion\nSince the time to reach the bottom of the ramp is the same for all ramps, the order of the ramps from the fastest to the slowest time it takes for the toy car to drop the full \\(1 \\, \\text{m}\\) is:\n\\[ 123 \\]\n\nSo the final answer is \\(\\boxed{123}\\)."], "doc_hash": "74234e98afe7498fb5daf1f36ac2d78acc339464f950703b8c019892f982b90b", "prompt_hash": "5894f2bd92cb99250539a45a0fa85513ae8301289ac6129b291a91e0dd51b42d", "target_hash": "0db52f4076c082518412afd3dd3576e2cb0c63703fd7fed5e23ade60efef31d9", "exact_match": 0, "input": "The following is a question from an International Mechanics competition.\nA small toy car rolls down three ramps with the same height and horizontal length, but different shapes, starting from rest.

The wind doesn't contribute in this direction, so we know the furthest point must have a vertical displacement of $d_{\\max }=\\frac{v^{2}}{g}$. We measure $d_{\\max }=0.50+0.25 \\cdot \\frac{11}{20}$ and solving for $v$ gives $d_{\\max }=2.50 \\mathrm{~m}$.\n\nNote that the answers aren't exactly the same due to measurement inaccuracies, so we asked for two significant digits.

Therefore, only vertical tension and gravitational forces act on the rod allowing for its center of mass to move in a straight vertical line. Using this fact, we can now write the acceleration of the rod in terms of angular velocity $\\omega$ and angular acceleration $\\varepsilon$. Let the angle of the rod at any moment to the vertical be $\\varphi$. For simplicity, we define the length of the rod to be $2 l$.

The height \\(h\\) can be expressed as:\n   \\[\n   h = r(1 - \\cos \\theta)\n   \\]\n   Substituting the given values \\(r = 1 \\text{ cm} = 0.01 \\text{ m}\\) and \\(\\theta = 8^\\circ\\):\n   \\[\n   h = 0.01 (1 - \\cos 8^\\circ) \\approx 0.01 (1 - 0.9903) = 0.000097 \\text{ m}\n   \\]\n   Therefore, the initial potential energy is:\n   \\[\n   U = mg \\cdot 0.000097\n   \\]\n\n2. **Energy Dissipation:**\n   The energy of the coin is dissipated through heat with a dissipation factor \\(k = 0.9\\). This means that after each collision, \\(90\\%\\) of the energy is conserved. The energy of the coin at any time \\(t\\) can be expressed as:\n   \\[\n   E(t) = U \\cdot k^n\n   \\]\n   where \\(n\\) is the number of collisions. As the coin comes to a complete stop, the energy \\(E(t)\\) will be zero. Therefore, we need to find the number of collisions \\(n\\) such that:\n   \\[\n   U \\cdot k^n = 0\n   \\]\n   Since \\(U \\neq 0\\), we need:\n   \\[\n   k^n \\to 0 \\quad \\text{as} \\quad n \\to \\infty\n   \\]\n   This implies that the coin will come to a complete stop after an infinite number of collisions. However, in practice, the coin will stop after a finite number of collisions due to the finite dissipation factor and the fact that the energy is not exactly zero but approaches zero.\n\n3. **Time Calculation:**\n   The time taken for the coin to come to a complete stop is not directly given by the energy dissipation factor alone. Instead, we need to consider the rotational dynamics of the coin. The coin will roll and rotate on the surface, and the time taken for the coin to stop can be approximated by considering the energy dissipation and the rotational dynamics.\n\n   The time taken for the coin to stop can be approximated by the time it takes for the energy to be dissipated to a negligible value. Given the dissipation factor \\(k = 0.9\\), the coin will stop after approximately 10 collisions (since \\(0.9^{10} \\approx 0.3486784401\\)).\n\n   The time taken for each collision can be approximated by the time it takes for the coin to roll and rotate to the next pivot point. The time for one complete rotation of the coin is given by the period of the rolling motion, which is approximately the time for the coin to roll and rotate once.\n\n   The time for one complete rotation is:\n   \\[\n   T = \\frac{2\\pi r}{v}\n   \\]\n   where \\(v\\) is the linear velocity of the coin. The linear velocity \\(v\\) can be approximated by the time it takes for the coin to roll and rotate once, which is approximately the time for the coin to roll and rotate once.\n\n   Therefore, the time taken for the coin to stop is approximately:\n   \\[\n   t \\approx 10 \\times \\frac{2\\pi r}{v} \\approx 10 \\times \\frac{2\\pi \\cdot 0.01}{0.01 \\cdot \\sqrt{2g \\cdot 0.000097}} \\approx 10 \\times \\frac{2\\pi \\cdot 0.01}{0.01 \\cdot \\sqrt{2 \\cdot 9.8 \\cdot 0.000097}} \\approx 10 \\times \\frac{2\\pi \\cdot 0.01}{0.01 \\cdot 0.192} \\approx 10 \\times \\frac{2\\pi}{1"]], "filtered_resps": ["To solve this problem, we need to analyze the motion of the coin and the energy dissipation process.

{"doc_id": 213, "doc": {"question_id": "1028", "subfield": "Optics", "context": "", "question": "<image_1>\n\nIn certain lakes there is a strange phenomenon called \"seiching\" which is an oscillation of the water. Lakes in which you can see this phenomenon are normally long compared with the depth and also narrow. It is natural to see waves in a lake but not something like the seiching, where the entire water volume oscillates, like the coffee in a cup that you carry to a waiting guest.\n\nIn order to create a model of the seiching we look at water in a rectangular container. The length of the container is $L$ and the depth of the water is $h$. Assume that the surface of the water to begin with makes a small angle with the horizontal. The seiching will then start, and we assume that the water surface continues to be plane but oscillates around an axis in the horizontal plane and located in the middle of the container.\n\nCreate a model of the movement of the water and derive a formula for the oscillation period $T$.

For a particle with constant energy $E$, it can be shown that of all the possible trajectories between two fixed points, the actual trajectory is the one on which $A$ defined above is an extremum (minimum or maximum).

Simple model of an atomic nucleus \n\nIntroduction\n\nAlthough atomic nuclei are quantum objects, a number of phenomenological laws for their basic properties (like radius or binding energy) can be deduced from simple assumptions: (i) nuclei are built from nucleons (i.e. protons and neutrons); (ii) strong nuclear interaction holding these nucleons together has a very short range (it acts only between neighboring nucleons); (iii) the number of protons $(Z)$ in a given nucleus is approximately equal to the number of neutrons $(N)$, i.e. $Z \\approx N \\approx A / 2$, where $A$ is the total number of nucleons $(A \\gg 1)$. Important: Use these assumptions in Tasks 1-4 below.\n\nTask 1 - Atomic nucleus as closely packed system of nucleons\n\nIn a simple model, an atomic nucleus can be thought of as a ball consisting of closely packed nucleons [see Fig. 1(a)], where the nucleons are hard balls of radius $r_{N}=0.85 \\mathrm{fm}\\left(1 \\mathrm{fm}=10^{-15} \\mathrm{~m}\\right)$. The nuclear force is present only for two nucleons in contact. The volume of the nucleus $V$ is larger than the volume of all nucleons $A V_{N}$, where $V_{N}=\\frac{4}{3} r_{N}^{3} \\pi$. The ratio $f=A V_{N} / V$ is called the packing factor and gives the percentage of space filled by the nuclear matter.\n\n<img_4362>\nContext question:\na) Calculate what would be the packing factor $f$ if nucleons were arranged in a \"simple cubic\" (SC) crystal system, where each nucleon is centered on a lattice point of an infinite cubic lattice [see Fig. 1(b)].\nContext answer:\n\\boxed{$\\frac{\\pi}{6}$}\n\n\nExtra Supplementary Reading Materials:\n\nImportant: In all subsequent tasks, assume that the actual packing factor for nuclei is equal to the one from Task 1a.

In a nucleus, each proton is not acting upon itself (by Coulomb force), but only upon the rest of the protons. One can take this into account by replacing $Z^{2} \\rightarrow Z(Z-1)$ in the obtained formula.

For example, if a nucleus (with zero velocity) is in an excited state with energy $E_{\\text {exc }}$ above the ground state, its mass is $m=m_{0}+E_{e x c} / c^{2}$, where $m_{0}$ is its mass in the ground state at rest. The nuclear reaction ${ }^{16} \\mathrm{O}+{ }^{54} \\mathrm{Fe} \\rightarrow{ }^{12} \\mathrm{C}+{ }^{58} \\mathrm{Ni}$ is an example of the so-called \"transfer reactions\", in which a part of one nucleus (\"cluster\") is transferred to the other (see Fig. 3). In our example the transferred part is a ${ }^{4} \\mathrm{He}-\\mathrm{cluster}(\\alpha$-particle). The transfer reactions occur with maximum probability if the velocity of the projectile-like reaction product (in our case: ${ }^{12} \\mathrm{C}$ ) is equal both in magnitude and direction to the velocity of projectile (in our case: ${ }^{16} \\mathrm{O}$ ). The target ${ }^{54} \\mathrm{Fe}$ is initially at rest. In the reaction, ${ }^{58} \\mathrm{Ni}$ is excited into one of its higher-lying states.

The magnetic field inside the tubes will remain constant due to the conservation of magnetic flux, but outside, the magnetic field will be changed. The magnetic field outside the straws is defined by the following condition: there is no circulation of $\\vec{B}$ (because there are no currents outside the straws); there are no sources of the field lines, other than the endpoints of the straws; each of the endpoints of the straws is a source of streamlines with a fixed magnetic flux $\\pm \\Phi$. These are exactly the same condition as those which define the electric field of four charges $\\pm Q$. We know that if the distance between charges is much larger than the geometrical size of a charge, the charges can be considered as point charges (the electric field near the charges remains almost constant, so that the respective contribution to the change of the overall electric field energy is negligible). Therefore we can conclude that the endpoints of the straws can be considered as magnetic point charges. In order to calculate the force between two magnetic charges (magnetic monopoles), we need to establish the correspondence between magnetic and electric quantities.\n\nFor two electric charges $Q$ separated by a distance $a$, the force is $F=\\frac{1}{4 \\pi \\varepsilon_{0}} \\frac{Q^{2}}{a^{2}}$, and at the position of one charge, the electric field of the other charge has energy density $w=\\frac{1}{32 \\pi^{2} \\varepsilon_{0}} \\frac{Q^{2}}{a^{4}}$; hence we can write $F=8 \\pi w a^{2}$.

Indeed, the force can be calculated as a derivative of the full field energy with respect to a virtual displacement of a field line source (electric or magnetic charge); if the energy densities of two fields are respectively equal at one point, they are equal everywhere, and so are equal the full field energies. As it follows from the Gauss law, for a point source of a fixed magnetic flux $\\Phi$ at a distance $a$, the induction $B=\\frac{1}{4 \\pi} \\frac{\\Phi}{a^{2}}$.

CERN is the world's largest particle physics laboratory. Its main goal is to get insight into the fundamental laws of nature. Two beams of particles are accelerated to high energies, guided around the accelerator ring by a strong magnetic field and then made to collide with each other. The protons are not spread uniformly around the circumference of the accelerator, but they are clustered in so-called bunches. The resulting particles generated by collisions are observed with large detectors. Some parameters of the LHC can be found in table 1 .\n\n| LHC ring |  |\n| :--- | :--- |\n| Circumference of ring | $26659 \\mathrm{~m}$ |\n| Number of bunches per proton beam | 2808 |\n| Number of protons per bunch | $1.15 \\times 10^{11}$ |\n| Proton beams |  |\n| Energy of protons | $7.00 \\mathrm{TeV}$ |\n| Centre of mass energy | $14.0 \\mathrm{TeV}$ |\n\nTable 1: Typical numerical values of relevant LHC parameters.\n\nParticle physicists use convenient units for the energy, momentum and mass: The energy is measured in electron volts $[\\mathrm{eV}]$. By definition, $1 \\mathrm{eV}$ is the amount of energy gained by a particle with elementary charge, e, moved through a potential difference of one volt $\\left(1 \\mathrm{eV}=1.602 \\cdot 10^{-19} \\mathrm{~kg} \\mathrm{~m}^{2} \\mathrm{~s}^{-2}\\right)$.\n\nThe momentum is measured in units of $\\mathrm{eV} / c$ and the mass in units of $\\mathrm{eV} / c^{2}$, where $c$ is the speed of light in vacuum. Since $1 \\mathrm{eV}$ is a very small quantity of energy, particle physicists often use $\\mathrm{MeV}\\left(1 \\mathrm{MeV}=10^{6} \\mathrm{eV}\\right)$, $\\mathrm{GeV}\\left(1 \\mathrm{GeV}=10^{9} \\mathrm{eV}\\right)$ or $\\mathrm{TeV}\\left(1 \\mathrm{TeV}=10^{12} \\mathrm{eV}\\right)$.\n\nPart A deals with the acceleration of protons or electrons.

Thus, the temperature $t_{1}$ corresponds to a kind of common boiling of both liquids that occurs in the region of their direct contact. The temperature $t_{1}$ is for sure lower than the boiling temperatures of the liquids $\\mathrm{A}$ and $\\mathrm{B}$ as then the pressures of the saturated vapors of the liquids $\\mathrm{A}$ and $\\mathrm{B}$ are less then $p_{0}$ (their sum equals to $p_{0}$ and each of them is greater than zero).\n\nIn order to determine the value of $t_{1}$ with required accuracy, we can calculate the values of the sum of the saturated vapors of the liquids A and B for several values of the temperature $t$ and look when one gets the value $p_{0}$.\n\nFrom the formula given in the text of the problem, we have:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\frac{p_{A}}{p_{0}}=e^{\\frac{\\alpha_{A}}{T}+\\beta_{A}}, \\\\\n& \\frac{p_{B}}{p_{0}}=e^{\\frac{\\alpha_{B}}{T}+\\beta_{B}} .\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\n$p_{A}+p_{B}$ equals to $p_{0}$ if\n\n$$\n\\frac{p_{A}}{p_{0}}+\\frac{p_{B}}{p_{0}}=1\n$$\n\nThus, we have to calculate the values of the following function:\n\n$$\ny(x)=e^{\\frac{\\alpha_{A}}{t+t_{0}}+\\beta_{A}}+e^{\\frac{\\alpha_{B}}{t+t_{0}}+\\beta_{B}}\n$$\n\n(where $t_{0}=273.15^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}$ ) and to determine the temperature $t=t_{1}$, at which $y(t)$ equals to 1 . When calculating the values of the function $y(t)$ we can divide the intervals of the temperatures $t$ by 2 (approximately) and look whether the results are greater or less than 1 .\n\nWe have:\n\n\n\nTable 1.2\n\n| $t$ | $y(t)$ |\n| :--- | :--- |\n| $40^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}$ | $<1($ see Tab. 1.1$)$ |\n| $77^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}$ | $>1\\left(\\right.$ as $t_{1}$ is less than $\\left.t_{b A}\\right)$ |\n| $59^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}$ | $0.749<1$ |\n| $70^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}$ | $1.113>1$ |\n| $66^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}$ | $0.966<1$ |\n| $67^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}$ | $1.001>1$ |\n| $66.5^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}$ | $0.983<1$ |\n\nTherefore, $t_{1} \\approx 67^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}$ (with required accuracy).\n\nNow we calculate the pressures of the saturated vapors of the liquids $A$ and $B$ at the temperature $t_{1} \\approx 67^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}$, i.e. the pressures of the saturated vapors of the liquids $\\mathrm{A}$ and $\\mathrm{B}$ in each bubble formed on the surface separating the liquids. From the equations (1) and (2), we get:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& p_{A} \\approx 0.734 p_{0}, \\\\\n& p_{B} \\approx 0.267 p_{0}, \\\\\n& \\left(p_{A}+p_{B}=1.001 p_{0} \\approx p_{0}\\right) .\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nThese pressures depend only on the temperature and, therefore, they remain constant during the motion of the bubbles through the liquid $\\mathrm{B}$. The volume of the bubbles during this motion also cannot be changed without violation of the relation $p_{A}+p_{B}=p_{0}$. It follows from the above remarks that the mass ratio of the saturated vapors of the liquids A and B in each bubble is the same. This conclusion remains valid as long as both liquids are in the system. After total evaporation of one of the liquids the temperature of the system will increase again (second sloped part of the diagram). Then, however, the mass of the system remains constant until the temperature reaches the value $t_{2}$ at which the boiling of the liquid (remained in the vessel) starts. Therefore, the temperature $t_{2}$ (the higher horizontal part of the diagram) corresponds to the boiling of the liquid remained in the vessel.\n\nThe mass ratio $m_{A} / m_{B}$ of the saturated vapors of the liquids $A$ and $B$ in each bubble leaving the system at the temperature $t_{1}$ is equal to the ratio of the densities of these vapors $\\rho_{A} / \\rho_{B}$. According to the assumption 2, stating that the vapors can be treated as ideal gases, the last ratio equals to the ratio of the products of the pressures of the saturated vapors by the molecular masses:\n\n$$\n\\frac{m_{A}}{m_{B}}=\\frac{\\rho_{A}}{\\rho_{B}}=\\frac{p_{A} \\mu_{A}}{p_{B} \\mu_{B}}=\\frac{p_{A}}{p_{B}} \\mu\n$$\n\nThus,\n\n$$\n\\frac{m_{A}}{m_{B}} \\approx 22.0\n$$\n\nWe see that the liquid A evaporates 22 times faster than the liquid B. The evaporation of $100 \\mathrm{~g}$ of the liquid A during the \"surface boiling\" at the temperature $t_{1}$ is associated with the\n\n\n\nevaporation of $100 \\mathrm{~g} / 22 \\approx 4.5 \\mathrm{~g}$ of the liquid B. Thus, at the time $\\tau_{1}$ the vessel contains 95.5 $\\mathrm{g}$ of the liquid $\\mathrm{B}$ (and no liquid $\\mathrm{A}$ ).

Let us introduce a Cartesian coordinate system on this unfolded plane so that point $O$ is the origin, axis $z$ is parallel with the axis of cylinder and directed downwards, axis $x$ is perpendicular to $z$ (i.e. horizontal).\n\n<img_4470>\n\nFig. 2\n\nConsider the forces acting on a small piece of the thread (with horizontal projection $\\Delta x$ ) indicated with red line in both figures. These are the tensions at both ends of the small piece exerted by neighbouring parts of the thread, the normal force $\\Delta N$ and the friction force $\\Delta f$ exerted by the cylinder.

Consider a point $Q$ on the end of the thread being pulled that coincided with $P$ at the moment when it touched the cylinder. Consider motion of the thread in a system of reference (SR), which rotates at angular speed $\\omega=u / R$ around the center of the cylinder. In that SR the part of the thread in contact with the cylinder is at rest and the point $Q$ rotates around the cylinder with the angular velocity $\\omega_{Q}=-\\omega$ (see the figure).\nSince the middle part of the thread is at rest, energy of the mass $P$ is conserved. For the same reason, the velocity $v_{P}$ of $P$ is perpendicular to the thread. Therefore the kinetic energy acquired by the mass in the rotating frame is equal to the decrease of its centrifugal potential energy:\n\n$$\n\\frac{1}{2} m v_{P}^{2}=-\\frac{1}{2} m \\omega^{2} R^{2}+\\frac{1}{2} m \\omega^{2} r^{2}=\\frac{1}{2} m \\omega^{2} l_{P}^{2}\n$$\n\nwhere $l_{P}$ is the length of the unwound part of the thread on the side of the mass $P$ (see the figure).

Therefore, at the moment of detachment:\n\n$$\nl_{P}=\\frac{1}{2}(2 \\pi R N)=\\pi N R\n$$\n\nand the detachment velocity of $P$ is, respectively:\n\n$$\nv_{P}=\\pi N u\n$$\n\nWhen transforming the velocity of $P$ to the Earth's SR, the velocity $\\vec{v}_{P}$ should be added to the rotational velocity $\\vec{\\omega} \\times \\vec{r}$.

This phenomenon can be modelled by a lens setup, see the photo on right, and the diagram beneath the photos.\n<image_1>\n\nThe photo on right was taken by a digital single-lens reflex camera. The light intensity at the camera sensor pixels marked by a red line (in the photo) is shown in the graph below: the log base 10 of the light intensity (measured as the number of photons caught by each pixel) is plotted against the $x$-coordinate, with the pixels' side length serving as the unit length.\n\n<image_2>\n\nThe lens modelling cat eyes can be treated as an ideal thin lens of focal length $f=55 \\mathrm{~mm}$ and diameter $D=$ $39 \\mathrm{~mm}$; however, you should keep in mind that the given graph shows real measurement data, and the lens has certain non-ideal features. Most importantly, partial reflections of brightly lit areas from the lens surfaces may decrease the contrast: dark areas seen through the lens appear less dark than they actually are; this effect can be neglected for the camera lens, but not so for the lens serving as a model of a cat's eye.\n\nBased on the given data, estimate (with the accuracy of ca 20\\%) the distance $h$ between the axis of the camera and the axis of the lamp (which can be considered as a point source) if the distance of the camera from the paper sheet was $L=4.8 \\mathrm{~m}$.", "final_answer": ["$80$"], "is_multiple_answer": false, "unit": "mm", "answer_type": "Numerical", "error": "16e0", "source": "OE_MM_physics_en_COMP", "solution": ["When you look at the photo of the lens and/or the graph provided, four regions with different brightness levels can be distinguished. The brightest region represents the magnified image of the blur spot created by the lamp through the lens. The blur spot is created because the distance from the lens to the white sheet beneath it is slightly larger than the focal distance; as we can see from the graph, the blur spot is of almost constant brightness (a flat plateau at $\\log _{10} I=4.4$ ), so we can say that the entire luminous flux falling from the lamp onto the lens is distributed evenly over the blur spot. Note that the blur spot has no sharp edges, though, as you would expect from in such case. This is because the image of this bright disc is situated between the lens and the camera, and is at a fairly big distance away from the plane which is sharp at the image sensor (as seen from the photo, the camera is focused onto the lens). Because of that, the enlarged image of the blur spot has blurred edges in the photo (at the blurred edges, $\\log _{10} I$ varies from 3.4 to 4.4). The second-brightest region (with $\\log _{10} I=3.4$ ) represents the scattered light from the brightest region: in that region, we are still looking through the lens, and see the area next to the bright blur spot on the sheet. Ideally, its should be darker than the sheet seen in those places where it is not obstructed by the lens, because the lens is shading the light from the lamp. However, the glass elements of this big lens are non-ideal (and there are many glass elements inside the lens!), so the light from the lamp and the bright blur spot is scattered towards the camera giving rise to an increased apparent brightness. In the area where we see the blur spot, this light is insignificant (much weaker than the light from the blur spot), but not so in this dark area: here, the scatteredfrom-the-glass-surfaces dominates heavily over the light coming from the paper sheet. As a matter of fact, this fact could be used to improve the accuracy of the calculations: we could subtract the contribution of the scattered light $\\left(10^{3.4}\\right)$ from the total intensity of the light at the brightest spot $\\left(10^{4.4}\\right)$ to obtain the contribution coming from the blur spot on the sheet. The darkest regions (with $\\log _{10} I<1.75$ ) represent the interior black painting of the lens seen through the big front glass element of the lens, which absorbs most of the incident light, and the region with $x>420$ and $\\log _{10} I=1.95$ represents the white sheet illuminated by the lamp. The ratio between the measured light intensity of the brightest region and that of the region with $x>420$ can be utilized to find the distance of the sheet (the blur spot) from the lens to the paper sheet $d_{0}$, see below.\n\nFrom the data given in the problem text we know that $L \\gg f$; from the photo of the lens, it is also clear that $d_{0}$ is of the same order of magnitude as $f$. Because of that, the illuminance $E$ (luminous flux per unit area) near the lens can be assumed to be the same as at the paper sheet, The luminous flux per solid angle and unit area of a lightscattering (or radiating) surface is called the luminance $\\mathscr{L}$; since all these directions under which the scattered light enters the lens aperture are close to the surface nor$\\mathrm{mal}$, we may assume the luminance of the paper sheet to be constant over all these directions. With the small\n\n\n\nangle approximation, the light intensity $I$ (illuminance, luminous flux $\\Phi$ per unit area) at the camera sensor is proportional to $\\mathscr{L}$ (see Explanation 1).\n\nThe luminance of the blur spot on the sheet $\\mathscr{L}_{B S}$ is $1 / k$ larger than the luminance $\\mathscr{L}_{s}$ of the paper sheet, where $k$ equals the ratio between the area of the bright dot (the blur spot) on the paper sheet and the area of the lens, because all the light received by the lens is \"compressed\" into the tiny blur spot.\n\nSmall angle approximation is also used to show that luminance of the image of the blur spot $\\mathscr{L}_{I}$ equals to the luminance of the blur spot $\\mathscr{L}_{B S}$ (see Explanation 2). Therefore, the light intensity at the sensor cells corresponding to the brightest area (where we see the image of the blur spot) $I_{I}=I_{s} / k$, where $I_{s}$ stands for the intensity at the cells corresponding to unobscured paper sheet. So, from the graph, we can deduce the value of $k$, and knowing $k$ we can calculate $d_{0}$. Let the distance along the axis between the image of the bright region through the lens and the lens itself be denoted as $d_{S}$; according to the Newton's lens formula, $\\left(d_{S}-f\\right)\\left(d_{0}-f\\right)=$ $f^{2}$. Hence,\n\n$$\nd_{S}=f+\\frac{f^{2}}{d_{0}-f}=\\frac{d_{0} f}{\\left(d_{0}-f\\right)}\n$$\n\ncan be also determined.\n\nHypothesize that $d_{0}-f \\ll f$. Let us calculate the diameter of the image of the blur spot\n\n$$\nD_{I}=\\frac{D_{B S} d_{S}}{d_{0}}=\\frac{D_{B S} f}{d_{0}-f}\n$$\n\nwhere the diameter of the blur spot on the sheet\n\n$$\nD_{B S}=\\frac{D\\left(d_{0}-f-s\\right)}{f+s} \\approx \\frac{D\\left(d_{0}-f-s\\right)}{f}\n$$\n\nand $s$ denotes the distance of the image of the point source from the focal plane. Using Newton's lens formula, $s=f^{2} /\\left(L-f-d_{0}\\right) \\approx f^{2} / L$, This leads us to\n\n$$\nD_{B S} \\approx D\\left(\\frac{d_{0}-f}{f}-\\frac{f}{L}\\right)\n$$\n\nand therefore\n\n$$\nD_{I} \\approx D\\left[1-\\frac{f^{2}}{L\\left(d_{0}-f\\right)}\\right]\n$$\n\nKeeping in mind that $d_{0}-f=\\frac{d_{0} f}{d_{S}} \\approx \\frac{f^{2}}{d_{S}}$, we obtain\n\n$$\nD_{I} \\approx D\\left(1-\\frac{d_{S}}{L}\\right)=\\frac{D\\left(L-d_{S}\\right)}{L} .\n$$\n\nThis means that as seen from the position of the camera, the angular size of the image of the blur spot $\\theta_{B S}=$ $D_{I} /\\left(L-d_{S}\\right)$ equals to the angular size of the lens aperture $\\theta_{L}=D / L$. This fact is easily confirmed from the photo and is an important observation for two reasons. First, it means that based on the angular diameter of the image of the blur spot on the photo, it is impossible to figure out the distance $d_{0}$ (and hence, $d_{S}$ ). Second, it allows us to measure instead of the angular distance $\\theta$ between the centre of the lens and the centre of the image of the blur spot (as seen from the position of the cameraline), the respective distance between the edges of the respective circles. Equality of these two angular sizes is also easily seen from the geometric construction, see the figure. Ineed, consider blue lines $S A G$ and $S B F$ which arrive from the lamp $S$ to the edges of the blur spot. Image of point $F$, denoted by $J$, is now easily found as the intersection point of the ray $S B F$ with the ray $F O$ (passing through the centre of the lens); image $H$ of the other edge of the blur spot is found in the same way. From this construction, it becomes clear that the angular size of the image of the blur spot and the lens, as seen from the camera, are exactly equal, without any approximation. Due to the smallness of the distance $h$, these angular sizes remain almost constant when the observation point is moved from $S$ to $C$.\n\nGiven the images are approximately circular, the area ratio $k$ equals $\\left(D_{B S} / D\\right)^{2}$, or\n\n$$\n\\pm \\sqrt{k}=\\frac{1}{f}\\left(d_{0}-\\frac{L f}{L-f}\\right)=\\frac{d_{0}}{f}-\\frac{L}{L-f}\n$$\n\nIn the above equation, the \\pm sign represents the two cases where the paper sheet is behind or in front of the image of the lamp. From the graph, the ratio between the intensity of the brightest region and the dark region with $x>420$ is $10^{4.4-1.95} \\approx 282$, which equals $1 / k$. Then, $d_{0} / f$ can be found to be $\\pm \\sqrt{k}+1+f / L$, which gives two solutions $d_{0} / f \\approx 1.07$ and $d_{0} / f \\approx 0.95$. According to the experimental settings given in the problem text, $d_{0}$ is greater than $f$, and thus we obtain $d_{0} / f \\approx 1.07$ and $d_{S} \\approx 15.03 f \\approx 83 \\mathrm{~cm}$. This also verifies the hypothesis that $d_{0}-f \\ll f$.\n\nThe centre of the image of the blur spot is positioned at the height $h^{\\prime}=h \\frac{d_{S}}{L}$ above the direction to the centre of the lens (this expression from similarity of the triangles $O Q P$ and $O C S$ ) which means that $\\theta=h^{\\prime} /\\left(L-d_{S}\\right)$; meanwhile, the angular diameter of the lens $\\theta_{L}=D / L$. Therefore,\n\n$$\n\\frac{\\theta}{\\theta_{L}}=\\frac{h d_{S}}{D\\left(L-d_{S}\\right)}\n$$\n\nThe ratio of the angular distances is easily measured from the figure as the ratio of the width $d_{c r}$ of the crescent-shaped second-brightest region to the diameter of the lense's aperture $D^{\\prime}$ :\n\n$$\nh=\\frac{d_{c r}}{D^{\\prime}} \\frac{D\\left(L-d_{S}\\right)}{d_{S}}\n$$\n\nBased on the graph, $d_{c r} \\approx 90$ pixels (midpoint of the blurry edge is around $x \\approx 120 \\mathrm{px}$, and the left edge of the aperture (in the graph) is at $x \\approx 30 \\mathrm{px}$; the right edge of the lens aperture is at $x \\approx 240 \\mathrm{px}$ corresponding to $D^{\\prime}=210 \\mathrm{px}$ and yielding $h \\approx 80 \\mathrm{~mm}$.\n\nRemark 1. In order to obtain the final answer with a reasonably good accuracy, it is not strictly speaking necessary to show that the apparent angular diameters of the lens and of the image of the blur spot are equal. All the other calculations remain the same, just one needs to match a circle with the circular segment of the visible edge of the blur spot, and measure directly $h^{\\prime}$, the distance between the centre of the lens and the centre of the blur spot, together with the diameter of the lens aperture $D^{\\prime}$ (see the small figure).\n\nRemark 2. The width of the crescent-shaped secondbrightest area can be also measured from the photo of\n\n\n\nthe lens with the required accuracy; however, measuring in pixels from the graph is more accurate.\n\nExplanation 1: Consider a small light source of luminance $\\mathcal{L}$ and surface area $S$ at a large distance $\\uparrow$ from the camera. The illuminance (the luminous flux per unit area) at the position of the camera is proportional to $\\uparrow^{-2}$ and so is the total luminous flux received by the whole sensor. Meanwhile, all this light energy is focused onto a small area $S^{\\prime}$ on the sensor - onto the image of the light source, and this area is also proportional to $\\uparrow^{-2}$. Therefore, the illuminance $I$ at the position of those sensor pixels which are covered by the image is independent of the distance $\\uparrow$.\n\nExplanation 2: Consider a very narrow cone of light of solid angle $\\omega$, starting from a very small area $S$ at the blur spot in a direction close to the surface normal, and carrying a total luminous flux $\\Phi$. Since the cone is narrow, this light beam is entirely caught by the lens at distance $d_{0}$, and focused onto the image of surface area $S^{\\prime}=S\\left(d_{S} / d_{0}\\right)^{2}$ at distance $d_{S}$ from the lens. The light rays of this beam traverse the focus and form another light cone of solid angle $\\omega^{\\prime}$ departing from the image. It is easy to see from similar triangles that $\\omega / \\omega^{\\prime}=\\left(d_{S} / d_{0}\\right)^{2}$. Then, the luminance of the image $\\mathcal{L}_{I}=\\Phi /\\left(S^{\\prime} \\omega^{\\prime}\\right)=\\Phi /(S \\omega)$, i.e. equal to the luminance of the blur spot.\n\n<img_4504>\n\n<img_4511>\n\nRemark 3: After having derived Explanation 1 and Explanation 2 and calculated $d_{0}$, the geometrical optics aspect can also be tackled by considering the image of the camera through the lens. The region bounded by the darkest ring in the image represents the area on the paper sheet that is observable by the camera through the lens. This area can be approximated by a circular spot with diameter $d$ (represented by $D^{\\prime}$ in the graph) depending negligibly on the size of the lens of the camera. Given small angles and that the lamp and the camera have equal distances to the lens, the bright spot on the paper sheet also has a diameter of $d$, which means $d=D \\sqrt{k}$. The angular distance between the lamp and the camera as seen from the center of the lens is $h /\\left(L-d_{0}\\right)$, and therefore, the distances between the two spots' centers, and also thus their boundaries (represented by $d_{c r}$ in the graph), on the paper sheet are $d_{0} h /\\left(L-d_{0}\\right)$. We then obtain an equivalent equation to that above:\n\n$$\n\\frac{d_{0} h /\\left(L-d_{0}\\right)}{D \\sqrt{k}}=\\frac{d_{c r}}{D^{\\prime}} \\Leftrightarrow h=\\frac{d_{c r}}{D^{\\prime}} D \\sqrt{k} \\frac{L-d_{0}}{d_{0}} \\approx 80 \\mathrm{~mm} .\n$$\n\nIt should be noted that, compared to the original analysis, the deviation in this calculation caused by $f / L$ (in finding $d_{0}$ and $d_{S}$ ) on the final result reduces drastically (from approximately $20 \\%$ down to approximately $1 \\%$ ). Even if $d_{0} \\approx f$ is assumed, the result is only deviated by approximately $7 \\%$."]}, "target": "answer", "arguments": {"0": "until", "1": "max_new_tokens", "2": "temperature", "3": "top_p", "4": "num_beams", "5": "do_sample"}, "resps": [["To solve this problem, we need to use the lens equation and the given data to estimate the distance \\( h \\) between the camera and the lamp.\n\n### Step 1: Lens Equation\nThe lens equation is given by:\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{f} = \\frac{1}{d_o} + \\frac{1}{d_i}\n\\]\nwhere:\n- \\( f \\) is the focal length of the lens,\n- \\( d_o \\) is the object distance (distance from the lamp to the lens),\n- \\( d_i \\) is the image distance (distance from the lens to the focal plane).\n\nGiven:\n- \\( f = 55 \\, \\text{mm} = 0.055 \\, \\text{m} \\)\n- \\( L = 4.8 \\, \\text{m} \\) (distance from the camera to the focal plane)\n\n### Step 2: Determine the Image Distance \\( d_i \\)\nThe image distance \\( d_i \\) can be found using the geometry of the setup.

{"doc_id": 232, "doc": {"question_id": "1541", "subfield": "Optics", "context": "Figure 1 shows a Fabry-Perot (F-P) etalon, in which air pressure is tunable. The F-P etalon consists of two glass plates with high-reflectivity inner surfaces. The two plates form a cavity in which light can be reflected back and forth. The outer surfaces of the plates are generally not parallel to the inner ones and do not affect the back-and-forth reflection. The air density in the etalon can be controlled. Light from a Sodium lamp is collimated by the lens L1 and then passes through the F-P etalon. The transmitivity of the etalon is given by $T=\\frac{1}{1+F \\sin ^{2}(\\delta / 2)}$, where $F=\\frac{4 R}{(1-R)^{2}}, \\mathrm{R}$ is the reflectivity of the inner surfaces, $\\delta=\\frac{4 \\pi n t \\cos \\theta}{\\lambda}$ is the phase shift of two neighboring rays, $\\mathrm{n}$ is the refractive index of the gas, $\\mathrm{t}$ is the spacing of inner surfaces, $\\theta$ is the incident angle, and $\\lambda$ is the light wavelength.\n\n<img_4392>\n\nFigure 1\n\nThe Sodium lamp emits D1 $(\\lambda=589.6 \\mathrm{~nm})$ and D2 $(589 \\mathrm{~nm})$ spectral lines and is located in a tunable uniform magnetic field. For simplicity, an optical filter F1 is assumed to only allow the D1 line to pass through. The D1 line is then collimated to the F-P etalon by the lens L1. Circular interference fringes will be present on the focal plane of the lens L2 with a focal length $\\mathrm{f}=30 \\mathrm{~cm}$. Different fringes have the different incident angle $\\theta$. A microscope is used to observe the fringes. We take the reflectivity $\\mathrm{R}=90 \\%$ and the inner-surface spacing $\\mathrm{t}=1 \\mathrm{~cm}$.\n\nSome physical constants: $h=6.626 \\times 10^{-34} \\mathrm{~J} \\cdot \\mathrm{s}, e=1.6 \\times 10^{-19} \\mathrm{C}, m_{e}=9.1 \\times 10^{-31} \\mathrm{~kg}, c=3.0 \\times 10^{8} \\mathrm{~ms}^{-1}$.\nContext question:\n(a) The D1 line $(\\lambda=589.6 \\mathrm{~nm})$ is collimated to the F-P etalon.

By slowly tuning the pin valve, air is gradually injected into the F-P etalon and finally the air pressure reaches the standard atmospheric pressure. On the same time, ten new fringes are observed to produce from the center of the ring patterns on the focal plane. Based on this phenomenon, calculate the refractive index of air $n_{\\text {air }}$ at the standard atmospheric pressure.\nContext answer:\n\\boxed{$1.00029$}\n\n\nContext question:\n(d)  Energy levels splitting of Sodium atoms occurs when they are placed in a magnetic field.

The splitting energy gap \\( \\Delta E_1 \\) and \\( \\Delta E_2 \\) can be expressed in terms of the diameters of the sub-fringes as follows:\n\n\\[\n\\Delta E_1 = \\frac{h c}{4 \\pi n \\lambda} \\left( \\frac{D_1 + D_3}{2} \\right)\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\Delta E_2 = \\frac{h c}{4 \\pi n \\lambda} \\left( \\frac{D_2 + D_4}{2} \\right)\n\\]\n\nwhere:\n- \\( h \\) is Planck's constant,\n- \\( c \\) is the speed of light,\n- \\( n \\) is the refractive index of the medium,\n- \\( \\lambda \\) is the wavelength of the light.\n\nSo the final answers are:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\Delta E_1 = 2 \\mu_B B, \\Delta E_2 = \\mu_B B}\n\\]"], "doc_hash": "74234e98afe7498fb5daf1f36ac2d78acc339464f950703b8c019892f982b90b", "prompt_hash": "f9aeda26a472cb272c2987ec3ac050deb7b946ed51aa2875a11082b35e0d599a", "target_hash": "0db52f4076c082518412afd3dd3576e2cb0c63703fd7fed5e23ade60efef31d9", "exact_match": 0, "input": "The following is a question from an International Optics competition.\n(e)  As shown in Fig. 4, when the magnetic field is turned on, each fringe of the D1 line will split into four sub-fringes $(1,2,3$, and 4$)$.
